# PRESS RELEASE

## JESSE AI Best Practices Framework Launches Context Server
MCP server eliminates 2-3 hours daily lost to AI context setup for development teams
GrowthTech, DevCorp, and TechForward among companies using automatic context loading
OPEN SOURCE ‚Äì June 26, 2025

**Senior developers can now eliminate the 2-3 hours daily lost to AI context setup and focus entirely on building features with JESSE AI Best Practices Framework, a comprehensive system that transforms AI coding assistants into intelligent, knowledge-aware development partners. Starting today, development teams can install the framework from GitHub and immediately benefit from persistent context management and automated knowledge capture.**

Today, Senior/Lead Developers at growth companies lose valuable development time restarting context and re-explaining project details, coding standards, and architectural decisions to AI assistants every development session when working on complex features. This means spending 2-3 hours per day managing context loss and explaining project details instead of building features, making it difficult to achieve the 30%+ productivity gains that AI assistants promise.

JESSE Framework addresses this by introducing an MCP Context Server that scans codebases up to 10,000 files in under 60 seconds and loads complete project context in 2-3 seconds instead of 15-30 minutes of manual explanation. Development teams can now benefit from instant context loading that replaces slow prompt engineering, background codebase scanning that identifies file purposes and relationships, and context that gets smarter as it learns project patterns over time. This differs from existing AI coding approaches because it combines persistent knowledge storage with automatic context loading, creating the only solution that preserves context between sessions and loads it instantly.

"We built JESSE Framework because we experienced this context loss problem ourselves and saw how it was holding back development teams everywhere," said Jean-Charles Jorel, Principal Solutions Architect. "Every developer using AI assistants faces the same frustration - explaining the same project details over and over. We created JESSE to eliminate that waste so developers can focus on what they do best: building amazing software."

To get started, development teams install JESSE Framework from GitHub with a simple command and configure the MCP server with automatic detection of existing projects. They can then initialize their knowledge base with guided project context capture and experience their first instant context load demonstrating immediate productivity gains. The experience integrates seamlessly with existing Cline workflows and development tools, requiring no changes to current processes while providing intelligent context that improves team consistency and code quality.

"I used to spend 20-30 minutes every morning re-explaining our microservices setup to ChatGPT - which endpoints connect where, our naming conventions, all that stuff," said Sarah Chen, Senior Software Engineer at GrowthTech. "Now I just open Cline and say 'update the user service' and it already knows our architecture. I actually get to write code instead of giving the same project tour every day."

"My biggest headache was junior developers getting different answers from AI because they explained our patterns differently," said Michael Rodriguez, Tech Lead at DevCorp. "One person would say 'we use REST APIs' while another explained our specific error handling. Now everyone's AI assistant has the same understanding of our codebase, so the code quality is way more consistent."

"I was worried about another background process eating up CPU, but honestly I forgot it was running until it caught an API inconsistency yesterday," said Lisa Wang, Engineering Manager at TechForward. "It pointed out that our payment service was using a deprecated endpoint that would have caused a production issue."

# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

## Customer-Facing FAQs

### What is JESSE AI Best Practices Framework?

JESSE is a system that saves AI coding assistants (particularly Cline) your project context so you don't have to re-explain it every session. The framework eliminates the 2-3 hours daily that developers lose to AI context setup by loading complete project knowledge in 2-3 seconds instead of 15-30 minutes of manual explanation.

### How does it work?

JESSE Framework uses an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that scans your codebase to understand file purposes and project architecture. When you start a development session, a single MCP call loads complete project context that previously took 15-30 minutes to explain manually. The system learns your coding patterns and gets smarter about your project over time.

### What does it cost?

JESSE Framework is completely open source and free to use. There are no licensing fees, subscription costs, or usage limits. Development teams can adopt the framework without any financial commitment while gaining immediate productivity benefits worth $150-225 daily per developer in time savings.

### How do I get started?

Getting started takes just 15 minutes:
1. Install JESSE Framework from GitHub with a simple command
2. Configure the MCP server (automatically detects existing projects)
3. Initialize your knowledge base with guided setup
4. Experience instant context loading in your first development session

New developers can be productive within hours instead of days, and the entire team benefits from consistent AI assistant behavior.

### What are the requirements?

JESSE Framework requires:
- Cline AI coding assistant (primary integration)
- Modern development environment (VS Code, Cursor, or similar)
- Git version control for your projects
- Node.js for MCP server functionality
- 100MB disk space for context storage

The framework works with existing development workflows without requiring changes to your current tools or processes.

### How is this different from GitHub Copilot or other AI coding tools?

JESSE Framework doesn't replace AI coding assistants - it makes them work better with your specific project. While tools like Copilot provide code suggestions, JESSE provides the project context that makes those suggestions accurate and consistent with your codebase. It's the only solution that saves your project context between sessions and loads it instantly when you start working.

### What if I have problems?

JESSE Framework provides comprehensive support:
- Complete documentation with setup guides and troubleshooting
- Active GitHub community for questions and solutions
- Issue resolution typically under 48 hours
- Community-contributed integrations and extensions
- Self-service resources for common scenarios

### Can I integrate with my existing development tools?

Yes, JESSE Framework integrates seamlessly with:
- IDEs: VS Code, Cursor, and other modern development environments
- Version Control: Git integration for context versioning and team sync
- CI/CD: Integration with build systems for deployment context
- Project Management: Connections with Jira, GitHub Issues for feature context
- Team Collaboration: Slack, Discord, and other communication tools
