# Problem Definition - JESSE AI Best Practices Framework

## Amazon Problem Definition Template - Primary Customer

### Refined Problem Statement (Senior/Lead Developers at Growth Companies)

**Today, Senior/Lead Developers at growth companies have to restart context and re-explain project details, coding standards, and architectural decisions to AI assistants every development session when working on complex features that require deep project knowledge.**

**This means spending 2-3 hours per day managing context loss and explaining project details instead of building features, making it difficult to achieve the 30%+ productivity gains that AI assistants promise.**

**These developers need a way to create persistent, intelligent AI assistants that remember project context, coding standards, and team knowledge so they can focus on high-value development work while maintaining consistent code quality across their entire team.**

## Supporting Evidence

### Data Source 1: Market Research
- 30% of developers achieve significant productivity gains when using AI for 30%+ of their code
- Market research shows "integration challenges" as top pain point for AI coding tools
- Enterprise adoption growing 25% annually, indicating demand for better solutions

### Data Source 2: Context Loss Impact Analysis
- Average development session requires 15-30 minutes of context setup with AI assistants
- Complex projects require re-explaining architecture, patterns, and conventions repeatedly
- Senior developers report spending more time managing AI context than coding

### Data Source 3: Customer Workflow Evidence  
- Growth companies (50-500 employees) have complex codebases requiring deep context
- Teams of 5-15 developers need consistent AI assistant behavior for code quality
- Lead developers responsible for both productivity and maintainability at scale

## Problem Validation Criteria

### Specificity Test: ✅ PASSED
- Problem is narrow enough to solve completely with persistent knowledge management
- Focuses on specific customer segment with defined characteristics
- Addresses concrete workflow issue rather than abstract need

### Customer Language Test: ✅ PASSED
