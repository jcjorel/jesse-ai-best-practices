## üìã Task Lifecycle Management

### Task Creation Workflow

**Command**: `/jesse_wip_task_create.md`

#### 1. Task Information Gathering
```bash
# Create new WIP task
/jesse_wip_task_create.md
```

**Prompts Include**:
- **Task Name**: Brief descriptive name (converted to snake_case)
- **Objective**: Clear statement of what needs to be accomplished
- **Target Timeline**: Estimated completion date
- **Scope**: What is included and excluded from this task
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes
- **Dependencies**: Internal and external requirements

#### 2. Parallel Task Risk Assessment
When existing WIP tasks are detected:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Multiple WIP Tasks Detected ‚ö†Ô∏è

You currently have [N] active WIP task(s). Working with multiple parallel WIP tasks carries significant risks:

‚Ä¢ State Inconsistency Risk: Changes made in one task may render other tasks out of sync
‚Ä¢ File Conflict Risk: Modifying files tracked in multiple tasks can create conflicts
‚Ä¢ Context Confusion: Switching between tasks may lead to mixing concerns

RECOMMENDATION: Create parallel WIP tasks ONLY when working on completely different sets of files and features.

To mitigate risks, would you like to restrict this new task to specific files or directories?
[Yes/No]
```

#### 3. File Restriction Options
When user chooses to restrict task scope:
- **File-Level Restrictions**: Specific source files
- **Directory-Level Restrictions**: Entire directories or modules
- **Feature-Level Restrictions**: Functional boundaries
- **Documentation**: Restrictions documented in task scope

### Task Directory Structure

#### Generated Structure
```
.knowledge/work-in-progress/[task_name_snake_case]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WIP_TASK.md                     # Task definition and learnings
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PROGRESS.md                     # Progress tracking and test results
```

### Task Activation and Context Loading

#### Session-Based Task Loading
The framework automatically loads the current task context at session start:

1. **Essential Knowledge Base**: Identifies current active task
2. **Task Context Loading**: Loads WIP_TASK.md and PROGRESS.md
3. **Knowledge Integration**: Connects task with relevant external resources
4. **Session Summary**: Displays current task status and next actions

#### Manual Task Control
```bash
# Disable task auto-loading for current session
/jesse_wip_task_disable.md

# Manually load task context
# (Task loading happens automatically at session start)
```

## üîÑ Task Operations

### Task Switching

**Command**: `/jesse_wip_task_switch.md`

#### Switch Process
1. **Current Task Capture**: Captures current session knowledge
2. **Task Selection**: Lists available WIP tasks for selection
3. **Context Switch**: Loads selected task context
4. **Session Update**: Updates Essential Knowledge Base with new current task

#### Context Preservation
```bash
# Automatic knowledge capture before switching
# Session knowledge -> Current task WIP_TASK.md
# Progress updates -> Current task PROGRESS.md
# Essential Knowledge Base -> Updated with new current task
```

### Task Progress Tracking

#### Automatic Progress Updates
The framework automatically captures progress through multiple mechanisms:

##### Test Result Auto-Update
```bash
# When ANY test is executed, PROGRESS.md is automatically updated:
## Test Status: [Test Name/Description]
**Status**: ‚úÖ PASSED | ‚ùå FAILED | üîÑ RUNNING | ‚è∏Ô∏è SKIPPED
**Timestamp**: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
**Test Command**: [exact command executed]
**Result Summary**: [brief outcome description]
**Details**: [relevant findings, error messages, or significant observations]
**Context**: [any additional context relevant to debugging or understanding]
```

##### Knowledge Auto-Capture
```bash
# External knowledge automatically captured to WIP_TASK.md:
# - Perplexity search results
# - Web browsing discoveries
# - External API learnings
# - Implementation patterns discovered
```

#### Manual Progress Updates
```bash
# Capture current session knowledge
/jesse_wip_task_capture_knowledge.md

# Manual progress tracking through task file updates
# Direct editing of PROGRESS.md for milestone completion
```
