## ü§ù Shared Knowledge Management

### Knowledge Base Architecture for Teams

The framework maintains knowledge that can be shared across team members:

#### Global Knowledge (Shared)
- **Location**: `.knowledge/persistent-knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`
- **Content**: Project-wide learnings, patterns, decisions
- **Access**: All team members read and contribute
- **Updates**: Automatic capture from any team member's work

#### Individual Knowledge (Personal)
- **Location**: `.knowledge/work-in-progress/[task_name]/`
- **Content**: Task-specific context and progress
- **Access**: Primarily individual, shared during handoffs
- **Updates**: Personal WIP task management

#### External Knowledge (Shared)
- **Git Clones**: `.knowledge/git-clones/[repo-name]_kb.md`
- **PDF Documents**: `.knowledge/pdf-knowledge/[doc-name]_kb.md`
- **Access**: Available to all team members
- **Updates**: Centrally managed, shared discoveries

### Team Knowledge Sharing Patterns

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev1 as Developer 1
    participant KB as Knowledge Base
    participant Dev2 as Developer 2
    
    Dev1->>KB: Discovers new pattern
    KB-->>KB: Auto-captures learning
    Dev2->>KB: Starts new session
    KB-->>Dev2: Loads shared knowledge
    Dev2->>KB: Builds on previous learning
    KB-->>Dev1: Available for next session
```

#### Automatic Knowledge Sharing
- **Perplexity Research**: Automatically shared across team
- **Web Browsing Discoveries**: Added to shared knowledge base
- **Test Results**: Captured in individual WIP tasks, extractable on completion
- **External API Learnings**: Shared in persistent knowledge base

#### Manual Knowledge Sharing
```bash
# Capture important discoveries for team
/jesse_wip_task_capture_knowledge.md

# Share completed task learnings
/jesse_wip_task_complete.md
```

## üë• Multi-Task Coordination

### Task Assignment Strategy

#### Task Isolation Approach
```mermaid
graph LR
    T1[Task A<br/>Authentication] --> F1[auth/ files]
    T2[Task B<br/>Database] --> F2[db/ files]
    T3[Task C<br/>Frontend] --> F3[ui/ components]
    
    F1 -.->|minimal overlap| F2
    F2 -.->|minimal overlap| F3
```

**Recommended Approach**:
- **File-based isolation**: Assign tasks that work on different file sets
- **Feature-based separation**: Each task owns a complete feature area
- **Minimal overlap**: Reduce conflicts through clear boundaries

#### Parallel Task Management

**Risk Assessment for Multiple Tasks**:
```bash
# When creating second task, framework warns about risks:
/jesse_wip_task_create.md
# ‚Üí Triggers multi-task risk assessment
# ‚Üí Provides mitigation options
```

**Risk Mitigation Options**:
1. **File Restrictions**: Limit each task to specific directories
2. **Sequential Processing**: Complete one task before starting another
3. **Careful Coordination**: Manual communication and planning

### Task Handoff Process

#### Outgoing Handoff (Passing Work to Teammate)
```bash
# 1. Complete current progress documentation
/jesse_wip_task_capture_knowledge.md

# 2. Commit work with detailed message
/jesse_wip_task_commit.md

# 3. Create handoff documentation
# Document in WIP task: current state, next steps, blockers
```

#### Incoming Handoff (Receiving Work from Teammate)
```bash
# 1. Switch to the task
/jesse_wip_task_switch.md

# 2. Review WIP task context
# Framework auto-loads: WIP_TASK.md and PROGRESS.md

# 3. Understand current state
# Read progress, review recent changes, check blockers
```

#### Handoff Documentation Template
```markdown
## Handoff Status - [Date]
**From**: [Developer Name]  
**To**: [Developer Name]
**Task**: [Task Name]

### Current State
- **Completed**: [What's been finished]
- **In Progress**: [What's partially done]
- **Blocked**: [Any blockers or dependencies]

### Next Steps
- **Immediate**: [What should be tackled first]
- **Priority**: [High priority items]
- **Optional**: [Nice-to-have improvements]

### Context Notes
- **Design Decisions**: [Key architectural choices made]
- **Gotchas**: [Things to watch out for]
- **Resources**: [Helpful documentation or references]

### Questions for Handoff Meeting
- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]
```

## üîÑ Standardized Git Workflows

### Team Commit Standards

The framework enforces consistent commit practices across all team members:

#### Automatic Commit Workflow
```bash
# Any team member using framework gets same standards
/jesse_wip_task_commit.md
```

**Standardized Commit Message Format**:
```
[TASK-TYPE] Brief description of changes

Detailed explanation of:
- What was changed and why
- Any breaking changes or important notes
- References to documentation updates

WIP Task: [current_task_name]
Knowledge Updates: [yes/no]
Documentation: [updated/created/none]
```

#### Pre-Commit Verification
The commit workflow automatically verifies:
- [ ] Documentation standards compliance
- [ ] File header updates with change history
- [ ] Function/class documentation completeness
- [ ] Knowledge base consistency
- [ ] No references to scratchpad files in production code

### Branch Management for Team Collaboration

#### Recommended Branch Strategy
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[main] --> B[feature/auth]
    A --> C[feature/database]
    
    B --> B1["auth: setup"]
    B1 --> B2["auth: validation"]
    
    C --> C1["db: schema"]
    C1 --> C2["db: migrations"]
    
    B2 --> D[merge to main]
    C2 --> D
    D --> E["integration commit"]
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#e1f5fe
```

**Branch Naming Convention**:
- `feature/[task-name]` - For new features
- `fix/[issue-description]` - For bug fixes  
- `docs/[update-type]` - For documentation updates
- `refactor/[component-name]` - For refactoring work

#### Integration Process
1. **Individual Development**: Work on feature branches
2. **Framework Compliance**: Use `/jesse_wip_task_commit.md` for all commits
3. **Documentation Sync**: Framework ensures consistent documentation
4. **Knowledge Integration**: Completed tasks feed shared knowledge base

## üìã Team Coordination Workflows

### Daily Standup Integration

#### Pre-Standup Preparation
```bash
# Review current task status
# Framework provides: WIP_TASK.md, PROGRESS.md automatically

# Check team knowledge updates
# Review .knowledge/persistent-knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md changes
```

#### Standup Status Template
```markdown
### [Developer Name] - [Date]

**Current Task**: [Task name and objective]
**Yesterday**: [Completed work with specific achievements]
**Today**: [Planned work with specific goals]
**Blockers**: [Any impediments requiring team help]

**Knowledge Shared**:
- [New patterns or learnings discovered]
- [Documentation created or updated]
- [External resources added to knowledge base]

**Team Impact**:
- [Changes that affect other team members]
- [Shared components modified]
- [Integration points updated]
```

2. **Gather Context**: Review change history and supporting evidence
3. **Team Discussion**: Discuss with involved team members
4. **Update Single Source**: Choose authoritative version
5. **Propagate Changes**: Update all related documentation

#### Merge Conflict Prevention
- **Regular Sync**: Frequent pulls and knowledge base reviews
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined task scope and file ownership
- **Communication**: Proactive sharing of architectural decisions

### WIP Task Conflicts

#### Multiple People Working on Related Tasks
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Task Conflict Detected] --> B{Overlap Type}
    B -->|File Overlap| C[Coordinate File Changes]
    B -->|Logic Overlap| D[Architectural Discussion]
    B -->|Timeline Overlap| E[Prioritize and Sequence]
    
    C --> F[Define File Ownership]
    D --> G[Create Shared Abstractions]
