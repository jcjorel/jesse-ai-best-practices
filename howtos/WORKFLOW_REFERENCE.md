## ðŸŽ¯ Workflow Usage Patterns

### Daily Development Workflow

#### Morning Session Startup
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start Cline Session] --> B[Auto-Load Knowledge]
    B --> C[Load Current WIP Task]
    C --> D[Review Progress]
    D --> E[Plan Session Work]
    
    E --> F{Need External<br/>Resources?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Import Git Repos<br/>or PDFs]
    F -->|No| H[Begin Development]
    G --> H
```

#### Development Session Flow
```bash
# Active development with automatic workflows:
# - Knowledge auto-capture (external searches, web browsing)
# - Test result auto-update
# - Progress tracking
# - Error handling and documentation

# Manual workflow triggers:
# - /jesse_wip_task_capture_knowledge.md (for significant insights)
# - /jesse_wip_task_check_consistency.md (quality assurance)
```

#### End-of-Session Workflow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Complete Session Work] --> B[Capture Session Knowledge]
    B --> C[Update Task Progress]
    C --> D{Ready to Commit?}
    D -->|Yes| E[/jesse_wip_task_commit.md]
    D -->|No| F[Save Session State]
    E --> G{Task Complete?}
    F --> H[End Session]
    G -->|Yes| I[/jesse_wip_task_complete.md]
    G -->|No| J[Switch Tasks or End]
    I --> H
    J --> H
```

### Knowledge Management Workflow

#### Research and Discovery
```bash
# External resource integration workflow:
1. /jesse_wip_kb_git_clone_import.md  # Import code repositories
2. /jesse_wip_kb_pdf_import.md        # Import documentation
3. Review and cross-reference knowledge bases
4. /jesse_wip_task_capture_knowledge.md  # Consolidate insights
```

#### Quality Assurance Cycle
```bash
# Regular knowledge quality maintenance:
1. /jesse_wip_task_check_consistency.md  # Verify integrity
2. Review and update trust sources
3. Clean up duplicate information
4. Update cross-references
```

### Multi-Task Development Workflow

#### Parallel Task Management
```bash
# Switching between tasks:
1. /jesse_wip_task_capture_knowledge.md  # Capture current work
2. /jesse_wip_task_switch.md            # Switch context
3. Review new task context and progress
4. Continue development

# Creating new tasks while others are active:
1. /jesse_wip_task_create.md            # Risk assessment provided
2. Consider file restrictions for conflict prevention
3. Document task dependencies
```

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Workflow Integration

### Custom Workflow Development

#### Creating Project-Specific Workflows
```bash
# Workflow file location:
# Global: ${HOME}/Cline/Workflows/custom_workflow.md
# Project: <project>/.clinerules/workflows/custom_workflow.md

# Standard workflow structure:
# 1. Workflow Purpose
# 2. Execution Steps
# 3. Workflow Completion
# 4. Error Handling
```

#### Workflow Template Structure
```markdown
# Custom Workflow Name

## Workflow Purpose
[Clear description of workflow objective]

## Execution Steps
### 1. [Step Name]
[Detailed step instructions]

### 2. [Step Name]
[Detailed step instructions]

## Workflow Completion
[Verification and completion criteria]

## Error Handling
[Recovery procedures and troubleshooting]
```

### Workflow Automation and Triggers

#### Automatic Workflow Triggers
```bash
# Workflows triggered automatically:
# - Knowledge capture (Perplexity, web browsing)
# - Test result updates (any test execution)
# - Session initialization (new Cline session)
# - Commit processing (user says "commit")
```

#### Conditional Workflow Execution
```bash
# Context-sensitive workflow behavior:
# - Task creation checks for existing tasks
# - Knowledge capture routes to appropriate location
# - Consistency checking adapts to current knowledge structure
```

### Workflow Performance Optimization

#### Context Window Management
```bash
# Workflows designed for efficiency:
# - Lazy loading of external resources
# - Incremental knowledge processing
# - Session state optimization
# - Large file handling in dedicated sessions
```

#### Workflow Coordination
```bash
# Workflows work together seamlessly:
# - Task workflows update knowledge base
# - Knowledge workflows inform task context
# - Quality workflows maintain consistency
# - Commit workflows enforce standards
```

## ðŸš€ Workflow Best Practices

### Effective Workflow Usage

#### Workflow Selection Guidelines
1. **Start Simple**: Use basic workflows before advanced features
2. **Follow Patterns**: Use established workflow sequences
3. **Monitor Context**: Be aware of context window usage
4. **Quality First**: Use consistency checking regularly

#### Workflow Timing
```bash
# Daily workflow timing:
# Morning: Task review and resource import
# During work: Automatic capture and manual knowledge updates
# End of session: Commit and completion workflows
# Weekly: Consistency checking and knowledge maintenance
```

### Troubleshooting Workflow Issues

#### Common Workflow Problems

##### Problem: Workflow Not Recognized
**Symptoms**: Command not found or not executing
**Solutions**:
1. Verify installation location (global vs project-level)
2. Check workflow file naming conventions
3. Ensure proper file permissions

##### Problem: Workflow Execution Failure
**Symptoms**: Workflow starts but fails partway through
**Solutions**:
1. Check prerequisite conditions
2. Verify file system permissions
3. Review context window usage
4. Check dependency availability

##### Problem: Knowledge Integration Issues
**Symptoms**: Workflows complete but knowledge not properly integrated
**Solutions**:
1. Run consistency checking workflow
2. Verify file structure integrity
3. Check cross-reference validity
4. Review trust source accessibility

### Workflow Maintenance

#### Regular Workflow Health Checks
```bash
# Monthly workflow maintenance:
1. Review workflow usage patterns
2. Update custom workflows based on project evolution
3. Clean up unused or outdated workflows
4. Optimize workflow sequences based on experience
```

#### Workflow Evolution
```bash
# Adapt workflows to project needs:
1. Create project-specific workflow variants
2. Customize workflow templates for domain
3. Develop workflow chains for common patterns
4. Document workflow best practices for team
```
