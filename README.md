# JESSE AI Best Practices Framework

A comprehensive framework that transforms AI coding assistants (particularly Cline) into intelligent, knowledge-aware development partners through structured knowledge management, automated workflows, and enforced coding standards.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The JESSE AI Best Practices Framework provides AI coding assistants with:

- **🧠 Persistent Knowledge Management**: Automatic capture and organization of learnings, external resources, and project context
- **📋 Structured Task Management**: Work-in-Progress tracking with automated progress monitoring and knowledge extraction
- **📖 Comprehensive Documentation Standards**: Enforced coding standards with automated header generation and consistency checking
- **🔄 Automated Workflows**: Ready-to-use workflows for common development tasks and knowledge operations
- **🔗 External Resource Integration**: Seamless integration with git repositories, PDFs, and web resources

## 🚀 Quick Installation for AI Coding Assistants

### One-Command Installation
```bash
# Clone to temporary directory and install automatically
git clone https://github.com/your-org/jesse-ai-best-practices.git /tmp/jesse-ai-setup && cd /tmp/jesse-ai-setup && bash artifacts/install.sh
```

### What This Does
1. **Clones the framework** to a temporary directory
2. **Prompts for installation location**:
   - **Global Installation** (Recommended): `${HOME}/Cline/Rules/` - Available across all projects
   - **Project-Level Installation**: `<current-project>/.clinerules/` - Project-specific setup
3. **Sets up directory structure** with proper `.gitignore` rules
4. **Initializes knowledge management** system with templates
5. **Activates framework** for immediate use

### Post-Installation Verification
```bash
# Verify installation (run from any project directory)
ls -la "${HOME}/Cline/Rules/" || ls -la ".clinerules/"
```

### Automated Workflows
- **28+ Ready-to-Use Workflows**: From task creation to knowledge management
- **Git Repository Integration**: Clone, index, and extract knowledge from external repos
- **PDF Processing**: Import, chunk, and index PDF documents with LLM understanding
- **Consistency Checking**: Automated verification of knowledge base integrity

## 🎮 Essential Commands for AI Assistants

### Session Management
```bash
# Mandatory session initialization (automatic in properly configured systems)
/jesse_session_init
```

### Task Management
```bash
# Create new WIP task
/jesse_wip_task_create.md

# Switch between tasks
/jesse_wip_task_switch.md

# Complete and extract learnings
/jesse_wip_task_complete.md
```

### Knowledge Operations
```bash
# Import git repository
/jesse_wip_kb_git_clone_import.md

# Import PDF document
/jesse_wip_kb_pdf_import.md

# Capture current knowledge
/jesse_wip_task_capture_knowledge.md
```

### Quality Assurance
```bash
# Check knowledge consistency
/jesse_wip_task_check_consistency.md

# Commit with standards compliance
/jesse_wip_task_commit.md
```
