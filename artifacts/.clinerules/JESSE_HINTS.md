## üö® CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULE: USER IDENTITY FILE üö®

### üìç MANDATORY FILE LOCATION ENFORCEMENT

**JESSE_USER_IDENTITY.md LOCATION REQUIREMENTS - STRICTLY ENFORCED:**

- **‚úÖ ONLY VALID LOCATION**: `${HOME}/Cline/Rules/JESSE_USER_IDENTITY.md`

- **‚ùå NEVER IN .clinerules/**: This file **MUST NEVER** be placed in project-level installation

### üîê PII PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS

**SECURITY ENFORCEMENT:**
- File contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Must remain exclusively in user's personal directory structure
- Framework MUST refuse to operate if file found in project repository
- AI assistant MUST display security violation warning if misplaced

### üìã MANDATORY USER INFORMATION FIELDS (9 REQUIRED)

**AI ASSISTANT MUST INTERACTIVELY COLLECT ALL 9 FIELDS:**

1. **User Firstname**: [User's first name]
2. **User Lastname**: [User's last name]

8. **User Company Name**: [Company name]
9. **User Company Corporate URL**: [Company website URL]

### ü§ñ INSTALLATION BEHAVIOR ENFORCEMENT

**MANDATORY AI ASSISTANT ACTIONS:**

1. **File Existence Check**: Always check if `${HOME}/Cline/Rules/JESSE_USER_IDENTITY.md` exists
2. **Interactive Collection**: If missing, prompt for ALL 9 required fields above
3. **Completeness Verification**: If exists, verify all 9 fields are present
4. **Global Location Only**: Create file ONLY at `${HOME}/Cline/Rules/JESSE_USER_IDENTITY.md`
5. **Security Validation**: Confirm file creation at correct location, never in project

### üõ°Ô∏è AUTOMATIC PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS

**AI ASSISTANT MUST ADD .gitignore PROTECTION:**

```gitignore
# JESSE AI Framework - User Identity Protection
# üö® CRITICAL: This file contains PII and must NEVER be committed üö®
JESSE_USER_IDENTITY.md
**/JESSE_USER_IDENTITY.md
.clinerules/JESSE_USER_IDENTITY.md
${HOME}/Cline/Rules/JESSE_USER_IDENTITY.md
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

**IF JESSE_USER_IDENTITY.md FOUND IN PROJECT REPOSITORY:**
- Framework MUST refuse to operate
- Display immediate security violation warning
- Require immediate file relocation to global location
- Warn about potential privacy compromise

### üö´ NON-NEGOTIABLE ENFORCEMENT

**THESE RULES HAVE NO EXCEPTIONS:**
- Security requirements cannot be bypassed
- Interactive collection cannot be skipped
- Global location requirement cannot be ignored
- PII protection measures cannot be disabled

## üéØ AI ASSISTANT COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

When installing JESSE AI Framework:

- [ ] Verified `${HOME}/Cline/Rules/JESSE_USER_IDENTITY.md` exists
- [ ] Confirmed all 9 required fields are present
- [ ] Ensured file is NOT in any project directory
- [ ] Added protective .gitignore patterns
- [ ] Validated security compliance before proceeding

**REMINDER**: These are mandatory security requirements, not suggestions. Framework operation depends on strict compliance with user identity protection rules.

## üîß CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULE: FEATURE LANGUAGE STANDARDS üîß

### üìã ESTABLISHED FUNCTIONALITY PRESENTATION

**MANDATORY LANGUAGE STANDARDS - STRICTLY ENFORCED:**

- **‚úÖ PRESENT ALL FEATURES AS ESTABLISHED**: Treat implemented functionality as standard system behavior
- **‚ùå NEVER USE "NEW" LANGUAGE**: Avoid words like "new", "enhanced", "recently added", "upgraded"
- **‚ùå NEVER USE TEMPORAL REFERENCES**: Avoid "now includes", "has been improved", "latest addition"
- **‚ùå NEVER TREAT AS SPECIAL**: Don't present standard functionality as exceptional or noteworthy

### üéØ AMAZON DOCUMENT EXCEPTION

**THIS RULE DOES NOT APPLY TO:**

- **Amazon PR/FAQ Documents**: PR/FAQ format specifically announces new features and capabilities
- **Working Backwards Documents**: Working Backwards methodology describes future/new functionality by design
- **Amazon-styled Product Announcements**: Documents following Amazon's product launch communication patterns

**EXCEPTION RATIONALE:**
These document types have specific purposes that inherently require "new feature" language as part of their standard format and communication objectives.

### üéØ REQUIRED PRESENTATION APPROACH (For Non-Amazon Documents)

**AI ASSISTANT MUST PRESENT FEATURES AS:**

1. **Standard System Behavior**: "WIP tasks include Git branch management" (not "WIP tasks now include...")
2. **Core Functionality**: "The system validates Git repository state" (not "The new validation feature...")
3. **Established Workflow**: "Task completion handles branch merging" (not "Enhanced completion workflow...")
4. **Normal Operation**: "Users can switch between task branches" (not "Users can now switch...")

### üö´ FORBIDDEN LANGUAGE PATTERNS (Outside Amazon Documents)

**THESE PHRASES ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED:**

- "New feature", "New functionality", "New capability"
- "Enhanced", "Improved", "Upgraded", "Better"
- "Now includes", "Now supports", "Now provides"
- "Recently added", "Latest addition", "Just implemented"
- "Updated to include", "Has been enhanced with"

### ‚úÖ CORRECT LANGUAGE PATTERNS (For Standard Documentation)

**USE THESE PRESENTATION APPROACHES:**

- "The system includes", "WIP tasks feature", "Workflows provide"
- "Standard functionality", "Core capability", "Built-in support"
- "Users can", "The workflow handles", "Tasks support"
- "Established behavior", "Normal operation", "Standard process"

### ü§ñ ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

**AI ASSISTANT MUST:**

1. **Identify document type**: Determine if content is Amazon PR/FAQ or Working Backwards format
2. **Apply appropriate rules**: Use standard language for system documentation, allow "new" language for Amazon documents
3. **Review all responses** for temporal or enhancement language before sending (except Amazon documents)
4. **Reframe feature descriptions** to present as established functionality (in non-Amazon contexts)

### üí° REASONING BEHIND THIS RULE

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**

- **User Confidence**: Users expect reliable, established functionality in system documentation
- **System Maturity**: Presents the framework as mature and stable
- **Clear Communication**: Avoids confusion about what's standard vs. experimental
- **Document Purpose**: Respects the specific communication objectives of different document types
- **Future-Proofing**: Prevents documentation from becoming outdated when features mature

### üö´ NON-NEGOTIABLE ENFORCEMENT

**THIS RULE HAS NO EXCEPTIONS (Outside Amazon Documents):**
- Language standards cannot be bypassed for convenience
- All system documentation must use established functionality language
- AI assistant must self-correct before sending responses
- Consistency across all non-Amazon documentation is mandatory

---

## üéØ AI ASSISTANT LANGUAGE COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

Before sending any response about system functionality:

- [ ] Verified content is not Amazon PR/FAQ or Working Backwards format
- [ ] Removed all "new", "enhanced", "improved" language
- [ ] Presented features as standard system behavior
- [ ] Used established functionality presentation patterns
- [ ] Avoided temporal references to implementation timing

**REMINDER**: Present all implemented functionality as the normal, expected way the system operates, not as special additions or improvements.
