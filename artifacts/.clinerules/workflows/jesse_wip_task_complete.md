# WIP Task Completion Workflow

## Workflow Purpose
Complete the current Work-in-Progress task, extract valuable learnings to persistent knowledge, handle Git branch operations, and properly archive the task.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Verify Active Task
Confirm there is an active WIP task to complete:
- Check Essential Knowledge Base for active task
- Verify task directory and files exist
- Display current task summary for user confirmation

### 1.5. Git Branch Assessment and Merge Assistance
After verifying the active task, check for Git branch integration:

**Check if WIP task has dedicated Git branch:**
- Read Git Integration section from WIP_TASK.md
- If no branch or "No dedicated branch": Continue to standard completion

**Check for Multiple WIP Tasks on Same Branch:**
- Scan other active WIP tasks for same branch
- If multiple tasks share the branch:
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple WIP Tasks - Manual Management Required
  
  Multiple WIP tasks detected on branch [branch_name]:
  - [task_1_name]
  - [task_2_name]  
  - [current_task_name] (completing)
  
  üìã Impact on Completion Process:
  ‚Ä¢ Cannot provide automated Git merge assistance
  ‚Ä¢ Cannot automatically archive in parent branch
  ‚Ä¢ YOU must manually manage Git operations
  ‚Ä¢ YOU must ensure task archival reaches parent branch
  
  üîß Your Manual Responsibilities:
  1. Merge/integrate your changes to parent branch when ready
  2. Archive completed WIP task files in parent branch
  3. Manage branch cleanup as appropriate
  
  üí° Recommendation: Avoid multiple WIP tasks per branch in future.
     One task per branch significantly reduces manual overhead and complexity.
  ```
  Continue to standard completion without Git assistance.

**Offer Merge Assistance (if single task on branch):**
```
üîÄ Git Branch Merge Assistance

Your WIP task is on dedicated branch: [branch_name]
Parent branch: [parent_branch_name]

Would you like assistance merging this branch back to [parent_branch_name]?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Yes, help me merge the branch
2Ô∏è‚É£ No, I'll handle Git operations manually

Choose option [1/2]:
```

**Manual Git Management Warning (if option 2 selected):**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Git Management - Your Responsibility

You chose to handle Git operations manually. This means:

üìã Your Responsibilities:
‚Ä¢ Merge your feature branch [feature_branch_name] to parent branch when ready  
‚Ä¢ Ensure WIP task archival is committed to parent branch [parent_branch_name]
‚Ä¢ The archived task files must be accessible from the parent branch
‚Ä¢ Manage branch cleanup as appropriate

‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Reminder: 
The WIP task will be archived on current branch [current_branch_name].
If you delete this branch before merging to parent, the archived task data 
may be lost from the main project history.

üîß Recommended Next Steps:
1. Complete this task workflow (archival happens on current branch)
2. Manually merge [feature_branch_name] to [parent_branch_name]  
3. Verify archived task files are accessible from parent branch
4. Clean up feature branch only after confirming parent branch has the data

Continuing with standard completion process...
```

**Present Merge Strategies (if assistance requested):**
```
üîÄ Git Merge Strategy Selection

Choose your merge strategy:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Fast-Forward Merge (if possible)
   ‚úÖ Clean, linear history
   ‚úÖ Simple and straightforward
   ‚ùå Only works if no other commits on parent branch
   ‚ùå Loses branch context in history

2Ô∏è‚É£ Three-Way Merge
   ‚úÖ Preserves complete branch history
   ‚úÖ Shows feature development context
   ‚ùå Creates merge commit
   ‚ùå More complex history graph

3Ô∏è‚É£ Squash and Merge
   ‚úÖ Clean single commit for entire feature
   ‚úÖ Simplified parent branch history
   ‚ùå Loses individual commit history
   ‚ùå Makes it harder to track specific changes

4Ô∏è‚É£ Rebase and Merge
   ‚úÖ Clean linear history with individual commits
   ‚úÖ Preserves commit granularity
   ‚ùå Rewrites commit history (timestamps change)
   ‚ùå More complex operation

Choose strategy [1-4]:
```

**Execute Merge Operation:**
- Switch to parent branch: `git checkout [parent_branch_name]`
- Execute selected merge strategy:
  - Option 1: `git merge [branch_name]` (fast-forward if possible)
  - Option 2: `git merge --no-ff [branch_name]` (force merge commit)
  - Option 3: `git merge --squash [branch_name]` then `git commit`
  - Option 4: `git rebase [branch_name]` then `git merge [branch_name]`
- Handle any merge conflicts with user guidance

**Update WIP Task Status (BEFORE archival):**
```
### üìù Update WIP Task Status

Updating WIP_TASK.md Git Integration section:
- Branch Status: Active ‚Üí Completed
- Completion Timestamp: [current_timestamp]
- Final Status: Task completed and ready for archival

Committing status update to feature branch before archival...
```

Execute:
- `git checkout [branch_name]` (switch back to feature branch temporarily)
- Update WIP_TASK.md Git Integration section
- `git add .knowledge/work-in-progress/[task_name]/WIP_TASK.md`
- `git commit -m "feat: Mark WIP task '[task_name]' as completed"`

**Parent Branch Switch for Archival:**
```
### üîÑ Parent Branch Archival Process

Switching to parent branch for task archival:
‚Ä¢ Current branch: [feature_branch_name] 
‚Ä¢ Parent branch: [parent_branch_name]
‚Ä¢ Switching: git checkout [parent_branch_name]

‚úÖ Now on parent branch: [parent_branch_name]

Proceeding with WIP task archival in parent branch context...
This ensures the completed task is preserved in the main branch history.
```

**Offer Branch Deletion:**
```
üóëÔ∏è Branch Cleanup

Branch [branch_name] has been successfully merged to [parent_branch_name].
WIP task has been archived in parent branch context.

Would you like to delete the feature branch [branch_name]?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Yes, delete the branch (keeps history clean)
2Ô∏è‚É£ No, keep the branch (for reference or future work)

Choose option [1/2]:
```

If user chooses deletion: `git branch -d [branch_name]`

### 2. Extract Task Learnings
Process WIP_TASK.md to extract reusable knowledge:
- **Key Discoveries**: Extract discoveries that apply beyond this specific task
- **Patterns Identified**: Document reusable patterns for future reference
- **Challenges & Solutions**: Extract solutions that could help with similar future challenges
- **Tools & APIs**: Document useful tools and API knowledge for persistent reference

### 3. Update Persistent Knowledge Base
Append extracted learnings to `.knowledge/persistent-knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`:
- Add new patterns to "Patterns and Solutions" section
- Add API knowledge to "External APIs" section
- Add web resources to "Web Resources" section if any were captured
- Maintain intemporal writing style (present tense, factual statements)

### 4. Generate Task Completion Summary
Create completion summary including:
- Task objective and final outcome
- Key achievements and deliverables
- Lessons learned and knowledge gained
- Time invested and efficiency metrics
- Recommendations for similar future tasks

### 5. Archive Task
Move completed task to archived location:
- Create timestamped directory in `.knowledge/work-in-progress/_archived/`
- Move entire task directory to archived location
- Preserve all task files and progress history
- Update archived task with completion timestamp and summary

### 6. Update Essential Knowledge Base
Update `.clinerules/JESSE_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT.md` Essential Knowledge Base section:
- Clear active task (set to "None")
- Update session context with completion
- Update "Next Actions" to suggest next steps
- Update timestamp

### 7. Display Completion Confirmation
Show user:
- Task completion confirmation
- Summary of knowledge extracted to persistent storage
- Archive location of completed task
- Suggestions for next actions or new tasks

## Knowledge Extraction Guidelines

### Intemporal Writing Standards
When extracting learnings to persistent knowledge:
- Write in present tense: "This approach works" not "This approach worked"
- State facts rather than historical events: "The API requires authentication" not "We discovered the API requires authentication"
- Focus on what IS known rather than what WAS learned
- Maintain consistency with existing knowledge entries

### Knowledge Categories
Extract learnings into appropriate categories:
- **Patterns**: Reusable approaches and architectural patterns
- **Solutions**: Specific solutions to common problems
- **APIs**: External service knowledge and usage patterns
- **Tools**: Useful development tools and their applications
- **Resources**: Valuable reference materials and documentation

## Workflow Completion
- Verify task is properly archived with all files intact
- Confirm persistent knowledge is updated with extracted learnings
- Verify Essential Knowledge Base reflects completion
- Check for knowledge consistency across all files

## Error Handling
- **No Active Task**: If no active task exists, inform user and suggest task switching or creation
- **Missing Task Files**: If task files are missing or corrupted, offer to complete with available information
- **Git Operation Failures**: If merge fails, provide manual resolution guidance and continue with standard completion
- **Branch Deletion Failures**: If branch deletion fails, warn user but continue with completion
- **Parent Branch Switch Failures**: If switching to parent branch fails, provide detailed error explanation and user options
- **Archival Failures**: If archival fails, preserve task in current location and provide detailed error explanation
- **Knowledge Extraction Failures**: If knowledge extraction fails, complete archival but warn about lost learnings
- **Partial Failures**: Provide rollback options if completion process fails partway through
- **Merge Conflicts**: Guide user through conflict resolution process before completing task

### Parent Branch Switch Failure Handling
If parent branch switch fails during archival process:
```
‚ùå Parent Branch Switch Failed

Attempted to switch from [feature_branch] to [parent_branch] but failed.

üîç Possible Causes:
‚Ä¢ Parent branch doesn't exist locally
‚Ä¢ Uncommitted changes preventing switch  
‚Ä¢ Git repository in unexpected state
‚Ä¢ Network issues if parent branch needs fetching

üîß Your Options:
1. Fix the Git issue manually and restart completion workflow
2. Complete archival on current branch (feature branch)
3. Cancel completion workflow to investigate

üìã Detailed Error Information:
[Git error message]
[Current Git status]

Please resolve the Git issue and choose how to proceed:
1Ô∏è‚É£ I fixed it, retry parent branch switch
2Ô∏è‚É£ Archive on current branch instead  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Cancel completion workflow

Choose option [1-3]:
```

## Post-Completion Options
After successful completion, offer user:
- Create new WIP task for next objective
- Switch to existing WIP task
- Review archived tasks for reference
- Update project documentation based on learnings
