# Amazon PR/FAQ & Working Backwards Coach Workflow

## CRITICAL: Context Window Management Protocol

**üö® MANDATORY CONTEXT MONITORING - EXECUTE THROUGHOUT COACHING SESSION üö®**

### Context Window Management Framework
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Monitor context window usage continuously during coaching session. When approaching **80% capacity**, immediately execute graceful halt procedure to save current state and complete session.

### Context Monitoring Checkpoints
Context window usage MUST be assessed at these critical points:
1. **After mandatory knowledge base loading**
2. **Before each Working Backwards stage (Listen, Define, Invent, Refine, Test & Iterate)**
3. **Before and after each MCP Perplexity research call**
4. **During PR/FAQ document creation phases**
5. **Before quality assessment activities**
6. **Before knowledge base integration**

### Graceful Halt Procedure (Execute at 80% Context Usage)
When context window reaches 80% capacity:

1. **IMMEDIATE STATE SAVING**:
   ```bash
   # Save current coaching progress
   echo "## Coaching Session State - $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")" >> working_backwards/current/coaching_session_state.md
   echo "**Context Halt Triggered**: 80% capacity reached" >> working_backwards/current/coaching_session_state.md
   echo "**Current Phase**: [Document current coaching phase]" >> working_backwards/current/coaching_session_state.md
   echo "**Completed Stages**: [List completed stages]" >> working_backwards/current/coaching_session_state.md
   echo "**Next Steps**: [Document specific next actions]" >> working_backwards/current/coaching_session_state.md
   echo "**User Context**: [Save relevant user responses and decisions]" >> working_backwards/current/coaching_session_state.md
   ```

2. **SESSION TERMINATION MESSAGE**:
   ```
   üîÑ CONTEXT WINDOW MANAGEMENT - GRACEFUL HALT INITIATED

   Context usage has reached 80% capacity. To maintain coaching quality and prevent context loss, 
   this session will now complete gracefully.

   ‚úÖ PROGRESS SAVED:
   - Current coaching phase: [Phase name]
   - Completed stages: [List stages]
   - Work-in-progress files updated
   - State preserved in working_backwards/current/

   üîÑ TO CONTINUE COACHING:
   1. Start a new [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) conversation session
   2. Say: "Resume Amazon PR/FAQ coaching"
   3. Your progress will be automatically loaded
   4. Coaching will continue from where we left off

   üìÅ Your work is preserved in:
   - working_backwards/current/coaching_session_state.md
   - working_backwards/current/[all current files]
   ```

3. **COMPLETE SESSION**: End current session after displaying termination message

### Session Resume Protocol
When user requests to resume coaching in a new session:

1. **LOAD SAVED STATE**:
   - Read `working_backwards/current/coaching_session_state.md`
   - Load all files in `working_backwards/current/` directory
   - Reconstruct coaching context from saved state

2. **RESUME CONFIRMATION**:
   ```
   üîÑ RESUMING AMAZON PR/FAQ COACHING SESSION

   ‚úÖ LOADED PREVIOUS STATE:
   - Previous phase: [Phase name]
   - Completed stages: [List stages]
   - Ready to continue from: [Next action]

   Shall we continue with your PR/FAQ development?
   ```

3. **CONTINUE COACHING**: Proceed from saved checkpoint

### Context Usage Guidelines
- **Monitor continuously**: Check usage before each major workflow step
- **Proactive management**: Begin graceful halt at 80%, not 90%+
- **State preservation**: Save all user inputs, decisions, and progress
- **Seamless continuation**: Enable smooth resume in fresh session
- **Quality maintenance**: Never compromise coaching quality due to context constraints

## MANDATORY: Knowledge Base Loading Protocol

**üö® CRITICAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENT - EXECUTE BEFORE ANY COACHING ACTIVITIES üö®**

Before launching the Amazon PR/FAQ coach, the standard mandatory knowledge base loading MUST be performed according to `JESSE_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT.md` session initialization protocol **BUT WITH SELECTIVE EXCLUSIONS**:

### Required Pre-Coach Execution Sequence:
1. **MANDATORY STEP 1**: Read `JESSE_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT.md` completely to load system rules and essential knowledge
2. **MANDATORY STEP 2**: Read `.knowledge/persistent-knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` for accumulated project knowledge
3. **MANDATORY STEP 3**: **LOAD WORKING BACKWARDS CONTEXT** - IF `<project_root>/working_backwards/` directory exists, automatically load ALL files within it to provide existing PR/FAQ and strategic planning context
4. **MANDATORY STEP 4**: **SKIP AVAILABLE KB LOADING** - Intentionally exclude git clone and PDF knowledge base files to maintain clean coaching context
5. **MANDATORY STEP 5**: **SKIP WIP TASK LOADING** - Intentionally exclude current WIP task context to maintain coaching focus  
6. **MANDATORY STEP 6**: Display brief context summary including core knowledge resources and working backwards context (excluding WIP task status and available KB status)
7. **MANDATORY STEP 7**: Only after ALL above steps are completed successfully, proceed with coach workflow

### Coach-Specific Knowledge Loading Rationale:
- **WIP Task Exclusion**: The coach workflow operates independently of current development tasks to maintain clear focus on strategic vision work
- **Available KB Exclusion**: Git clone and PDF knowledge bases are excluded to prevent context pollution from unrelated external knowledge during strategic planning
- **Clean Context**: Avoiding WIP task and available KB context prevents interference between operational development work and strategic planning
- **Dedicated Session**: The coach creates its own working context in `working_backwards/current/` directory with minimal external dependencies

### Compliance Verification:
Before starting any coaching activities, internally verify:
- [ ] Knowledge management rules loaded
- [ ] Essential knowledge base accessed
- [ ] **Working backwards context loaded (if directory exists)**
- [ ] **Git clone knowledge bases INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED**
- [ ] **PDF knowledge bases INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED** 
- [ ] **WIP task context INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED**
- [ ] Context summary provided to user (including working backwards context status)
- [ ] All mandatory steps completed successfully

**FAILURE TO EXECUTE THIS MANDATORY SEQUENCE CONSTITUTES A CRITICAL SYSTEM ERROR**

```
SEATTLE ‚Äì March 12, 2015 ‚Äì Amazon Prime members in Manhattan can now get 
everyday essentials delivered in as little as one hour with Prime Now, 
a new service from Amazon.

Prime Now offers thousands of daily essentials for busy families who need 
items quickly but don't have time for traditional shopping trips.

"We're excited to bring ultra-fast delivery to our Prime members," 
said Dave Clark, VP of Worldwide Operations. "Sometimes you just can't 
wait for even our industry-leading two-day delivery."

To use Prime Now, customers simply open the app, add items to their cart, 
and choose one-hour delivery for $7.99 or free two-hour delivery. 
Professional shoppers pick items and deliver directly to the customer's door.

"I needed diapers at 10 PM and had them by 11 PM," said Sarah Chen, 
a working mother in Brooklyn. "This saves me so much time with my busy schedule."
```

**üì± Echo - Technical Innovation Made Simple**
*Source: Internal Amazon PR/FAQ*

```
SEATTLE ‚Äì June 23, 2015 ‚Äì Amazon today announced Echo, a hands-free speaker 
you control with your voice. Echo connects to Alexa to play music, 
provide information, news, sports scores, weather, and more‚Äîinstantly.

Just ask, and Alexa responds. Echo hears you from across the room with 
seven microphones that use beam-forming technology and noise cancellation.

"We wanted to create something that would be incredibly useful and also 
disappear into the home," said Greg Hart, VP Echo & Alexa. "You just talk 
to it naturally, like you would a person."

Echo works from anywhere in the room‚Äîeven while music is playing. 
Say "Alexa," followed by your request, and Echo responds instantly. 
It gets smarter over time, adding new capabilities through the cloud.

"My kids ask Alexa to play their favorite songs while doing homework," 
said Maria Rodriguez, an Echo customer. "It's become part of our daily routine."
```

#### B2B/Enterprise Examples

**‚öôÔ∏è AWS DevOps Guru - ML-Powered Operations**
*Source: Internal Amazon PR/FAQ*

```
SEATTLE ‚Äì December 1, 2020 ‚Äì Amazon Web Services announced DevOps Guru, 
a machine learning service that helps developers improve application 
availability by automatically detecting operational issues.

DevOps Guru helps development teams reduce application downtime by identifying 
problems before they impact customers, eliminating the need for manual 
monitoring and reactive troubleshooting.

"We built DevOps Guru because our own teams needed a way to detect issues 
faster," said Swami Sivasubramanian, VP of Machine Learning at AWS. 
"Now any development team can benefit from the same ML-powered insights."

Development teams simply enable DevOps Guru in their AWS account. The service 
automatically analyzes their applications and provides recommendations when it 
detects unusual behavior patterns that indicate potential problems.

"DevOps Guru caught a performance issue that would have caused an outage 
during our peak traffic period," said David Kim, Lead Engineer at TechCorp. 
"It saved us hours of debugging and prevented customer impact."

Amazon's Working Backwards is built around answering 5 fundamental questions:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[üéØ WHO is the customer?] --> B[‚ùó WHAT is the problem?]
    B --> C[üí° WHAT is the solution?]
    C --> D[‚ú® WHAT is the experience?]
    D --> E[üìä HOW do we measure success?]
    
    A1[Specific segment<br/>Data-driven insights<br/>Research-backed] -.-> A
    B1[Today, customer have to...<br/>Quantified impact<br/>Evidence-based] -.-> B
    C1[3-5 evaluated options<br/>Clear differentiation<br/>Amazon advantages] -.-> C
    D1[End-to-end journey<br/>Concrete and visual<br/>Integration points] -.-> D
    E1[Quantitative + Qualitative<br/>Business + Behavioral<br/>Unintended consequences] -.-> E
```

**Stage-by-Stage Deep Dive:**

#### Stage 1: LISTEN - Customer Understanding

**Core Principle**: Move beyond assumptions to research-backed customer insights

**Key Activities:**
- **Customer Research Method Selection**: Surveys, interviews, analytics, observation
- **Data Source Identification**: First-party data, third-party research, competitive analysis
- **Customer Persona Development**: Specific segments with real characteristics
- **Insight Validation**: Test assumptions with actual customer data

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ‚ùå "All users need this" (too broad)
- ‚ùå "Customers want faster/better/cheaper" (generic)
- ‚ùå "Based on our experience" (assumption-driven)

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Customer segment is specific and well-defined
- ‚úÖ Insights are data-driven, not assumptions
- ‚úÖ Multiple data sources validate findings
- ‚úÖ Customer language and pain points are clearly understood

#### Stage 2: DEFINE - Problem Crystallization

**Core Principle**: Use Amazon's problem definition template for clarity and focus

**Amazon's Problem Definition Template:**
```
Today, [specific customer segment] have to [current limitation/friction] 
when [triggering situation]. 

This means [impact/consequence for customer], making it difficult to 
[customer goal/desired outcome].

Customers need a way to [specific capability/solution] so they can 
[desired benefit/result].

Supporting Evidence:
- Data Source 1: [Specific evidence with numbers]
- Data Source 2: [Quantified impact or frequency]  
- Data Source 3: [Customer quotes or research findings]
```

**Problem Validation Framework:**
- **Specificity Test**: Is the problem narrow enough to solve completely?
- **Data Validation**: What evidence supports this problem's existence?
- **Customer Language**: Are we using their words, not our internal terms?
- **Impact Assessment**: What's the quantified consequence of this problem?

#### Stage 3: INVENT - Solution Development

**Core Principle**: Generate and evaluate multiple solutions using Amazon's criteria

**Structured Brainstorming Process:**
1. **Generate 3-5 Solution Options** (minimum requirement)
2. **Evaluate Using Amazon's Matrix:**
   - **Customer Impact**: High/Medium/Low
   - **Implementation Effort**: High/Medium/Low  
   - **Time to Market**: Fast/Medium/Slow
   - **Amazon Leverage**: How does this use our unique advantages?

**Solution Selection Criteria:**
- **Customer Value**: Does this solve the problem completely?
- **Differentiation**: Why is this better than existing alternatives?
- **Amazon Advantages**: How does this leverage our unique capabilities?
- **Most Lovable Product (MLP)**: What's the minimum viable version customers will love?

**Alternative Documentation Requirement:**
Document rejected alternatives and reasoning to prevent future re-litigation.

#### Stage 4: REFINE - Experience Design

**Core Principle**: Design the complete end-to-end customer experience

**Customer Journey Mapping Framework:**
1. **Discovery**: How do customers find your solution?
2. **First Use**: What's the onboarding experience like?
3. **Core Value Delivery**: What's the "aha" moment?
4. **Ongoing Usage**: How does it integrate into their workflow?
5. **Support & Growth**: How do they get help and expand usage?

**The ONE Benefit Identification:**
Every solution must have ONE primary benefit that customers care about most. This becomes your headline value proposition.

**Customer Vignette Creation:**
```
Meet [Customer Name], [Customer Context/Role].

[Customer Name] needs to [core job-to-be-done] but currently faces 
[specific problem] when [triggering situation].

Here's what a typical day looks like:
[2-3 sentences describing current state with problem]

With [Product/Service]:
[2-3 sentences describing improved experience]

The result: "[Customer quote expressing satisfaction/relief/benefit]"
```

#### Stage 5: TEST & ITERATE - Success Definition

**Core Principle**: Define comprehensive success metrics before building

**Amazon's Comprehensive Metrics Framework:**

**Quantitative Metrics:**
- **Revenue Impact**: Specific dollar amounts and timeframes
- **Adoption Rate**: Percentage of target customers using within defined period

- **Growth Rate**: Month-over-month or year-over-year expansion

**Qualitative Metrics:**
- **Customer Satisfaction**: NPS scores and satisfaction ratings
- **Customer Sentiment**: Brand perception and feedback themes
- **Support Quality**: Resolution times and satisfaction scores

**Behavioral Metrics:**
- **Customer Behavior Changes**: What customers do differently
- **Retention Improvements**: How usage patterns evolve
- **Cross-sell/Upsell Impact**: Effects on other product usage

**Business Impact Metrics:**
- **Strategic Value**: How this advances larger company goals
- **Market Position**: Competitive advantage gained
- **Operational Efficiency**: Internal process improvements

**Unintended Consequences Planning:**
- **Potential Negative Impacts**: What could go wrong?
- **Mitigation Strategies**: How to prevent or address problems
- **Long-term Responsibilities**: Ongoing commitments and resource needs

**üéì Learning Checkpoint:**
After each stage, complete this validation:
```
Stage [X] Completion Check:
‚ñ° I understand the core principle
‚ñ° I can apply the framework to my situation  
‚ñ° I know the common mistakes to avoid
‚ñ° I have the tools and templates needed
‚ñ° I'm ready to move to the next stage

What's my biggest learning from this stage?
[Write your insight]
```

### 2. Working Backwards Assessment (For New PR/FAQ)

**üîÑ Context Loading Protocol:**
Before beginning, load all current Working Backwards context:

```bash
for file in working_backwards/current/*.md; do 
  if [ -f "$file" ]; then 
    echo "=== BEGIN FILE: $file ==="; 
    cat "$file"; 
    echo ""; 
    echo "=== END FILE: $file ==="; 
    echo ""; 
  fi; 
done
```

**Working Backwards Directory Initialization:**
If this is a new PR/FAQ session, create the working file structure:

```bash
# Initialize working files for this session
touch working_backwards/current/pr_faq_draft.md
