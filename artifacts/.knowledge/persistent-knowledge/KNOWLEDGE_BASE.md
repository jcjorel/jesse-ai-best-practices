# Project Knowledge Base
*Last Updated: 2025-06-24T17:48:00Z*

## Session-Specific Knowledge Loading Strategy
**LAZY LOADING APPROACH**: Knowledge bases related to the current session task are loaded on-demand when specifically needed, rather than automatically at session initialization. This approach:

- **Reduces Context Window Usage**: Only loads relevant knowledge bases for the current task
- **Improves Performance**: Avoids loading unnecessary external repository content
- **Maintains Focus**: Keeps session context aligned with current work objectives
- **Enables Selective Access**: Allows targeted knowledge base consultation when specific expertise is required

**Loading Triggers**: Knowledge bases are loaded when:
- User explicitly requests information from a specific repository or PDF
- Current task requires specific external API or framework knowledge
- Implementation needs reference patterns from external sources
- Debugging requires consultation of external documentation

**Available Knowledge Sources**:
- Git Clone Knowledge Bases: `.knowledge/git-clones/[repo-name]_kb.md`
- PDF Knowledge Bases: `.knowledge/pdf-knowledge/[source-name]/[source-name]_kb.md`
- Essential Knowledge Base: Always loaded (this file)

## PDF Knowledge Usage Requirements
**CRITICAL**: When using knowledge from imported PDF knowledge bases, you MUST also open and read the associated PDF chunk files to get full clarity and complete context about the knowledge. PDF chunk files are always located in `.knowledge/pdf-knowledge/[source-name]/pdf_chunks/<PDF-chunk-filename>`.

**Mandatory Process**:
1. **Reference PDF Knowledge Base**: First consult `.knowledge/pdf-knowledge/[source-name]/[source-name]_kb.md` for indexed knowledge
2. **Access Original Chunks**: Always open and read the corresponding PDF chunk files referenced in the knowledge base entry
3. **Verify Context**: Cross-reference the chunk content with the summarized knowledge to ensure complete understanding
4. **Use Complete Information**: Base decisions and implementations on the full context from both the knowledge base summary and the original PDF chunks

**PDF Chunk Naming Convention**: PDF chunks are stored with specific naming pattern:
- **Location**: `<project_root>/.knowledge/pdf-knowledge/<imported_pdf_name>/pdf_chunks/`
- **Naming Format**: `<imported_pdf_name>_pages_<page_number_start>_<page_number_end>.pdf`
- **Example**: `.knowledge/pdf-knowledge/user_manual/pdf_chunks/user_manual_pages_001_020.pdf`

**Locating PDF Chunks**: To find the correct PDF chunk(s) to read:
1. Identify the imported PDF name from the knowledge base entry
2. Navigate to `<project_root>/.knowledge/pdf-knowledge/<imported_pdf_name>/pdf_chunks/`
3. Look for files matching pattern `<imported_pdf_name>_pages_<start>_<end>.pdf`
4. Select chunks based on the page range containing the information you need

**Why This Is Required**:
- Knowledge base entries are summaries and may not contain all critical details
- PDF chunks contain the complete original context and nuanced information
- Implementation decisions require full understanding of the source material
- Error prevention through comprehensive information access

## Knowledge Entry Requirements
**MANDATORY**: All knowledge entries must include one or more trust sources to enable deep-dive verification and validation. Trust sources can be:
- Complete relative file paths to codebase files (e.g., `src/services/api_service.py`)
- Git cloned repository references (e.g., `.knowledge/git-clones/framework-docs_kb.md`)
- Web URLs with specific sections (e.g., `https://docs.example.com/api/v1/authentication.html`)
- Documentation file references (e.g., `doc/DESIGN.md#architecture-overview`)

**Format**: Each knowledge entry must end with:
```
**Trust Sources**:
- [Source Type]: [Complete path/URL/reference]
- [Source Type]: [Complete path/URL/reference]
```
