# JESSE Framework Development - Project Knowledge Base
*Last Updated: 2025-07-01T10:37:00Z*

# üö® CRITICAL: Framework-Wide Session Initialization Requirement

## Mandatory Session Initialization Command
**EVERY JESSE FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT SESSION MUST START WITH:**
```bash
cd jesse-framework-mcp && uv run python tests/test_project_root.py --dump
```
NOTE: Do not forget the "cd" when you launch the command or it will fail!

**REQUIREMENT LEVEL**: üîí **HARD BLOCKING** - Development work cannot proceed without this  
**SCOPE**: All JESSE Framework development sessions (framework-wide requirement)  
**ENFORCEMENT**: Manual verification required before any development activity
**CRITICAL**: You MUST run this command once as soon as possible even in PLAN mode

### What This Command Does:
- Enriches working context with essential project structure information
- Provides comprehensive session initialization resource content  
- Validates project root detection and configuration
- Ensures proper FastMCP context setup for all development work

### Verification Steps:
1. Command must complete successfully without errors
2. Must generate substantial output (multiple sections of project context)
3. Output must include project structure, session initialization, and resource content
4. Any errors indicate improper project setup requiring resolution before proceeding

### Consequences of Not Running:
- ‚ùå Incomplete project context leading to incorrect development decisions
- ‚ùå Missing critical project structure information
- ‚ùå Potential code generation in wrong locations or with wrong patterns
- ‚ùå Session may fail to understand project architecture and constraints

## Session-Specific Knowledge Loading Strategy
**LAZY LOADING APPROACH**: Knowledge bases related to the current session task are loaded on-demand when specifically needed, rather than automatically at session initialization. This approach:

- **Reduces Context Window Usage**: Only loads relevant knowledge bases for the current task
- **Improves Performance**: Avoids loading unnecessary external repository content
- **Maintains Focus**: Keeps session context aligned with current work objectives
- **Enables Selective Access**: Allows targeted knowledge base consultation when specific expertise is required

**Loading Triggers**: Knowledge bases are loaded when:
- User explicitly requests information from a specific repository or PDF
- Current task requires specific external API or framework knowledge
- Implementation needs reference patterns from external sources
- Debugging requires consultation of external documentation

**Available Knowledge Sources**:
- Git Clone Knowledge Bases: `.knowledge/git-clones/[repo-name]_kb.md`
- PDF Knowledge Bases: `.knowledge/pdf-knowledge/[source-name]/[source-name]_kb.md`
- Essential Knowledge Base: Always loaded (this file)

## Project Purpose
