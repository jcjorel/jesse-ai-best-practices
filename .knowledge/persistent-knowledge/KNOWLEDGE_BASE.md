# JESSE Framework Development - Project Knowledge Base
*Last Updated: 2025-06-26T14:19:00Z*

## Session-Specific Knowledge Loading Strategy
**LAZY LOADING APPROACH**: Knowledge bases related to the current session task are loaded on-demand when specifically needed, rather than automatically at session initialization. This approach:

- **Reduces Context Window Usage**: Only loads relevant knowledge bases for the current task
- **Improves Performance**: Avoids loading unnecessary external repository content
- **Maintains Focus**: Keeps session context aligned with current work objectives
- **Enables Selective Access**: Allows targeted knowledge base consultation when specific expertise is required

**Loading Triggers**: Knowledge bases are loaded when:
- User explicitly requests information from a specific repository or PDF
- Current task requires specific external API or framework knowledge
- Implementation needs reference patterns from external sources
- Debugging requires consultation of external documentation

**Available Knowledge Sources**:
- Git Clone Knowledge Bases: `.knowledge/git-clones/[repo-name]_kb.md`
- PDF Knowledge Bases: `.knowledge/pdf-knowledge/[source-name]/[source-name]_kb.md`
- Essential Knowledge Base: Always loaded (this file)

## Project Purpose
The JESSE AI Best Practices Framework is a comprehensive system that transforms AI coding assistants (particularly Cline) into intelligent, knowledge-aware development partners through structured knowledge management, automated workflows, and enforced coding standards.

**Meta-Development Context**: This project uses the JESSE Framework to develop the JESSE Framework itself, providing real-world testing of framework capabilities during development.

**Trust Sources**:
- Codebase: `README.md`
- Codebase: `HOWTO_USE.md`
- Documentation: `howtos/AI_ASSISTANT_INTEGRATION.md`

## Critical Framework Separation
**ðŸš¨ FRAMEWORK SEPARATION PROTOCOL ðŸš¨**:
- **Framework we're BUILDING**: `artifacts/` directory contains all framework components under development
- **Framework we're USING**: Global installation (`${HOME}/Cline/Rules/`) + `.knowledge/` project files for managing THIS project

**Trust Sources**:
- Project Structure: `artifacts/.clinerules/` (framework components being developed)
- Project Structure: `.clinerules/JESSE_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT.md` (project management)

## Key Development Patterns

### Framework Component Development
**Pattern**: Develop all framework components in `artifacts/` directory
**Implementation**:
- All JESSE_*.md files developed in `artifacts/.clinerules/`
- All workflow files developed in `artifacts/.clinerules/workflows/`
- Complete isolation from operational framework files
- Clear separation between "building" vs "using"

**Benefits**:
- No confusion between framework versions
- Safe testing of framework modifications
- Clear deployment path from development to production

**Trust Sources**:
- Directory Structure: `artifacts/.clinerules/`
- Directory Structure: `artifacts/.clinerules/workflows/`

### Documentation-Driven Development
**Pattern**: Maintain comprehensive documentation in `howtos/` directory
**Implementation**:
- Each major component has corresponding howto guide
- Clear usage instructions for framework users
- Visual diagrams and examples for complex concepts
- Cross-referenced documentation preventing duplication

**Benefits**:
- Framework users have clear guidance
- Development decisions are documented
- Examples demonstrate real usage patterns

**Trust Sources**:
- Documentation: `howtos/KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT.md`
- Documentation: `howtos/TASK_MANAGEMENT.md`
- Documentation: `howtos/CODING_STANDARDS.md`
- Documentation: `howtos/WORKFLOW_REFERENCE.md`

### Meta-Development Testing
**Pattern**: Using JESSE Framework to develop JESSE Framework itself
**Implementation**:
- Framework dogfooding during development
- Real-world testing of all framework capabilities
- Continuous improvement through self-application
- Knowledge capture about framework design decisions

**Benefits**:
- Framework quality validation through actual usage
- Documentation accuracy verification
- Workflow effectiveness confirmation
- Edge case discovery and resolution

**Trust Sources**:
- Development Process: This knowledge management system usage
- Development Process: WIP task workflows used for framework development

## Development Environment
### Repository Structure
**Primary Directories**:
- **artifacts/**: Framework components we're building (JESSE_*.md files, workflows)
- **howtos/**: User documentation and guides  
- **Root files**: README.md, HOWTO_USE.md, LICENSE
- **.knowledge/**: Our project knowledge management (what we're using)
- **.clinerules/**: Project-specific configuration

**Trust Sources**:
- Repository Structure: Root directory listing
- Directory Structure: `artifacts/` vs operational directories

### Global Framework Installation
**Location**: `${HOME}/Cline/Rules/` and `${HOME}/Cline/Workflows/`
**Purpose**: Provides framework capabilities for managing THIS project
**Separation**: Complete isolation from `artifacts/` development components

**Trust Sources**:
- Installation: `${HOME}/Cline/Rules/JESSE_*.md`
- Installation: `${HOME}/Cline/Workflows/jesse_*.md`

## Available Knowledge Sources (Lazy Loading)
**Note**: These knowledge bases are loaded on-demand when specifically needed for the current session task, following the lazy loading strategy described above.

### Git Clone Knowledge Bases
*No git clone knowledge bases configured yet*

**To add a git clone knowledge base**:
1. Use the Git Clone Import workflow: `/jesse_wip_kb_git_clone_import.md`
2. The workflow will clone the repository and create the knowledge base
3. Git clones are stored in `.knowledge/git-clones/[repo-name]/`
4. Knowledge bases are created as `.knowledge/git-clones/[repo-name]_kb.md`

### PDF Knowledge Bases
*No PDF knowledge bases imported yet*

**To import a PDF knowledge base**:
1. Use the PDF Import workflow: `/jesse_wip_kb_pdf_import.md`
2. The workflow will process the PDF and create indexed knowledge base
3. PDFs are stored in `.knowledge/pdf-knowledge/[pdf-name]/`
4. Knowledge bases are created as `.knowledge/pdf-knowledge/[pdf-name]/[pdf-name]_kb.md`
5. PDF chunks are stored in `.knowledge/pdf-knowledge/[pdf-name]/pdf_chunks/`
