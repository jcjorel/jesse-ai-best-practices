# Directory Knowledge Base {PROJECT_ROOT}/.clinerules/

## Global Summary

#### Functional Intent & Features

This directory serves as the project-specific configuration and rule management system for the JESSE Framework development environment, providing centralized coordination for development sessions, mandatory initialization protocols, and comprehensive project state tracking. The directory contains essential configuration files that enforce development workflow standards, manage project context, and coordinate meta-development activities where the JESSE Framework is used to build itself. Key semantic entities include `JESSE_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT.md` configuration file, `uv run python jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_project_root.py --dump` mandatory initialization command, `.knowledge/persistent-knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` knowledge base integration, `.knowledge/work-in-progress/` task management system, `artifacts/.clinerules/` framework development area, `${HOME}/Cline/Rules/` global framework installation, `FastMCP-based` knowledge indexing system, `Hierarchical Semantic Context` pattern implementation, `/jesse_wip_task_switch` task coordination command, and comprehensive separation protocols distinguishing between framework components being developed versus operational framework tools being used. The system enables coordinated development sessions with proper project context initialization while maintaining clear architectural boundaries between development artifacts and operational framework files.

##### Main Components

The directory contains one primary configuration file: `JESSE_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT.md` which serves as the central coordination hub for all JESSE Framework development activities. This file establishes five major functional areas: Framework-Wide Session Initialization Requirements with hard blocking enforcement protocols, Essential Knowledge Base management tracking active work-in-progress tasks and completed projects, Quick Access Links providing navigation to key project directories, Project Context definitions establishing meta-development workflows and critical separation protocols, and Development Patterns documentation covering meta-development context, framework component development workflows, and documentation-driven development practices with comprehensive trust source validation.

###### Architecture & Design

The directory architecture implements a centralized project coordination pattern with mandatory session initialization enforcement and clear separation between development artifacts and operational framework components. The design establishes a meta-development workflow where the JESSE Framework is used to develop itself, creating real-world testing scenarios and continuous improvement cycles through self-application. The configuration system follows a hierarchical organization with persistent knowledge bases, work-in-progress task tracking, and archived completion records. The separation protocol maintains strict boundaries between `artifacts/` directory containing framework components under development and operational framework files in global installation and `.knowledge/` project files, preventing confusion between building versus using framework capabilities.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation strategy employs mandatory command execution patterns with hard blocking requirements ensuring proper project context initialization before any development activity. The system utilizes directory-based organization with `.knowledge/work-in-progress/` for active tasks and `_archived/` subdirectories for completed work management. Task coordination implements explicit switching mechanisms through `/jesse_wip_task_switch` command with clear documentation of inactive tasks. The meta-development approach implements self-application testing where framework capabilities are validated through actual usage during framework development. Documentation-driven development maintains comprehensive guides in `howtos/` directory with cross-referenced content preventing duplication and ensuring consistency through trust source validation.

- **Integration Pattern**: Used by developers at session start for initialization, task management systems for work coordination, documentation workflows for maintaining comprehensive project knowledge, and separation protocol enforcement ensuring clear boundaries between development artifacts and operational framework files

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The system handles session initialization failures through hard blocking enforcement preventing development work from proceeding without proper project context establishment. Task switching scenarios are managed through explicit `/jesse_wip_task_switch` command usage with clear documentation of inactive tasks and systematic task state management. Meta-development confusion between building versus using framework components is addressed through critical separation protocol documentation and comprehensive trust source validation. Archive management handles completed tasks through systematic `_archived/` directory organization with timestamp-based naming conventions ensuring proper historical tracking. Documentation consistency is maintained through cross-referenced trust sources and comprehensive howto guide integration preventing information duplication and ensuring accuracy across all project documentation.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The mandatory session initialization uses specific command syntax `uv run python jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_project_root.py --dump` with hard blocking requirement level and enforcement across both PLAN and ACT development modes. Task tracking maintains timestamp-based updates using ISO 8601 format (`2025-07-01T10:39:00Z`) and status indicators using emoji-based visual markers (‚úÖ for completed tasks, üö® for critical requirements). Directory organization follows systematic patterns with `.knowledge/` prefix for all knowledge management files and `artifacts/` prefix for framework development components. Trust source validation references specific files including `README.md`, `HOWTO_USE.md`, and directory structures providing authoritative information sources. Archive naming conventions use timestamp suffixes (`_20250701_0900`) for systematic organization and efficient retrieval of completed work.

########### Usage Examples

**Mandatory session initialization and project setup:**

This command sequence demonstrates the required initialization process for every JESSE Framework development session. The initialization establishes proper project context and must be executed regardless of whether starting in PLAN or ACT mode.

```bash
# Execute mandatory session initialization (hard blocking requirement)
uv run python jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_project_root.py --dump

# Verify project structure and context
ls -la .clinerules/
cat .clinerules/JESSE_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT.md
```

**Task management and project navigation workflow:**

This pattern demonstrates comprehensive task coordination and project navigation capabilities. The commands provide access to different project areas and enable systematic task switching and management.

```bash
# Switch to different WIP task (when multiple tasks exist)
/jesse_wip_task_switch

# Navigate to key project directories for development coordination
ls -la .knowledge/persistent-knowledge/
ls -la .knowledge/work-in-progress/
ls -la artifacts/.clinerules/
```

**Framework development separation protocol:**

This example shows the proper approach for maintaining separation between building framework components and using operational framework capabilities. The workflow ensures components are developed in correct directory structures while maintaining clear architectural boundaries.

```bash
# Develop framework rules in artifacts directory (building framework)
ls -la artifacts/.clinerules/JESSE_*.md
ls -la artifacts/.clinerules/workflows/

# Reference operational framework files (using framework)
ls -la ${HOME}/Cline/Rules/
cat .knowledge/persistent-knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md
```
