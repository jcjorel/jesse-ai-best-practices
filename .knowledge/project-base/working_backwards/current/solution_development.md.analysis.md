#### Functional Intent & Features

This solution development document provides comprehensive analysis and selection methodology for addressing context loss problems in AI-assisted development workflows, serving as the strategic foundation for the JESSE AI Best Practices Framework's core technical architecture. The document delivers systematic solution evaluation using Amazon's invention methodology, comparative analysis of five distinct technical approaches, and detailed implementation roadmap for the selected solution. Key semantic entities include `Amazon's Solution Evaluation Process` methodology, `Stage 3: INVENT` framework phase, `Intelligent MCP Context Server` breakthrough solution, `Cline` AI assistant integration, `MCP server` architecture, `Background-scanning` technology, `Semantic context database` implementation, `Intent-driven context selection` capability, `File purpose indexing` system, `Phase 1/2/3` implementation timeline, `Most Lovable Product (MLP)` feature definition, evaluation matrix with `Customer Impact`, `Implementation Effort`, `Time to Market` criteria, and comprehensive rejection rationale for four alternative approaches. The framework establishes technical solution selection through quantitative evaluation criteria and provides detailed implementation strategy spanning 12+ months across three distinct development phases.

##### Main Components

The document contains six primary content sections: Problem Statement Recap establishing the core customer challenge of 2-3 hours daily context loss for senior developers, 5 Solution Options Generated section detailing Persistent Knowledge Base System, AI Assistant Training Platform, Session Context Management Automation, Intelligent MCP Context Server, and Integration-First Development Workflow approaches, Amazon's Evaluation Matrix section providing systematic comparison across Customer Impact, Implementation Effort, Time to Market, Amazon Advantages, and Strategic Value criteria, Selected Solution section documenting the Intelligent MCP Context Server choice with detailed selection rationale and Most Lovable Product feature definitions, Rejected Alternatives Documentation section explaining dismissal reasons for four alternative approaches, and Implementation Strategy section outlining three-phase development timeline with specific technical milestones and capability progression.

###### Architecture & Design

The solution architecture implements a phased development approach structured around MCP server integration with progressive capability enhancement across three distinct phases. The design separates immediate context loading improvements (Phase 1) from advanced semantic understanding capabilities (Phase 2-3), enabling incremental value delivery while building toward comprehensive intelligent context selection. The evaluation framework architecture employs Amazon's systematic solution assessment methodology with quantitative scoring across five key criteria dimensions. The selected solution architecture combines background scanning technology with semantic context databases and intent-driven selection algorithms, creating a comprehensive context management system that evolves from basic MCP integration to advanced codebase intelligence and cross-project correlation capabilities.

####### Implementation Approach

The development strategy employs a three-phase implementation approach with specific technical milestones and capability progression. Phase 1 (3-4 months) focuses on MCP server foundation development, replacing prompt engineering with fast context loading, implementing on-demand background scanning, basic file purpose indexing, and performance optimization for developer laptops. Phase 2 (6-8 months) introduces intelligent context selection through LLM integration, advanced semantic codebase analysis, context relevance scoring and selection, and smart context summarization capabilities. Phase 3 (12+ months) delivers advanced intelligence including codebase relationship understanding, predictive context suggestions, team knowledge sharing, and cross-project context correlation. The approach emphasizes performance optimization, seamless integration with existing Cline workflows, and progressive enhancement of context intelligence capabilities.
