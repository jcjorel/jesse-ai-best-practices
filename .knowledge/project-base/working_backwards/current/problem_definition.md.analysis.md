#### Functional Intent & Features

The `problem_definition.md` file serves as a strategic problem validation document implementing Amazon's Problem Definition Template for the JESSE AI Best Practices Framework, providing structured analysis of customer pain points and market validation to guide product development decisions. This document enables product teams to validate problem-market fit through evidence-based analysis and customer-centric problem articulation, evidenced by the refined problem statement targeting Senior/Lead Developers at growth companies and comprehensive validation criteria including specificity, customer language, data validation, and impact assessment tests. Key semantic entities include `Amazon Problem Definition Template`, `Senior/Lead Developers`, `growth companies`, `context loss`, `AI assistants`, `project details`, `coding standards`, `architectural decisions`, `development session`, `productivity gains`, `persistent knowledge management`, `integration challenges`, `market research`, `workflow evidence`, `validation criteria`, `specificity test`, `customer language test`, `data validation test`, and `impact assessment`. The document implements a systematic problem validation approach that quantifies customer pain points (2-3 hours daily context management) and establishes evidence-based rationale for solution development through multiple data sources and validation frameworks.

##### Main Components

The document contains four primary sections: refined problem statement with customer-specific articulation, supporting evidence from three data sources, problem validation criteria with four validation tests, and secondary customer problems analysis. The problem statement section defines the specific challenge faced by Senior/Lead Developers at growth companies regarding context loss and AI assistant management. The supporting evidence section includes market research data showing 30% productivity gains and integration challenges, context loss impact analysis quantifying 15-30 minute setup requirements, and customer workflow evidence describing team dynamics and responsibilities. The validation criteria section implements four tests (specificity, customer language, data validation, impact assessment) with pass/fail indicators, and the secondary problems section identifies additional customer segments including DevOps/Platform Engineers and Product Owners with their respective challenges.

###### Architecture & Design

The document follows Amazon's Problem Definition Template structure, organizing content around customer-centric problem articulation with evidence-based validation rather than solution-focused analysis. The design implements a hierarchical validation framework progressing from problem statement through supporting evidence to systematic validation criteria, ensuring comprehensive problem validation before solution development. The architecture uses structured sections with clear validation checkpoints, quantified impact statements, and multiple customer perspectives to establish credible problem foundation. The template structure supports both internal strategic alignment and external stakeholder communication by combining technical specificity with business impact quantification and market validation evidence.

####### Implementation Approach

The document employs a quantitative validation approach that uses specific metrics throughout, including 30% productivity gains targets, 2-3 hours daily time loss, 15-30 minute context setup requirements, and 25% CAGR market growth rates. The approach combines primary customer research with market analysis to establish credible problem statements and validation criteria. Problem articulation uses customer-specific language avoiding internal jargon while maintaining technical accuracy for developer audiences. Validation testing implements systematic criteria evaluation with pass/fail indicators to ensure problem definition meets Amazon's standards for customer-centric product development and market validation requirements.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The document addresses potential validation risks through comprehensive problem validation criteria that test specificity, customer language accuracy, data validation, and impact assessment to prevent solution development based on incorrect problem understanding. Market validation risks include problem mischaracterization, incorrect customer segment identification, and insufficient evidence supporting problem significance. The validation framework handles edge cases where problems may be too broad, use internal jargon, lack supporting data, or have unclear impact through systematic testing criteria with pass/fail indicators. The document manages the risk of secondary problem dilution by clearly identifying primary problem focus while acknowledging additional customer segments without losing strategic clarity.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The document uses specific validation checkmarks (✅ PASSED) to provide visual confirmation of problem validation criteria completion across all four test categories. Problem quantification employs precise metrics including 2-3 hours daily impact, 15-30 minute session setup requirements, and 30% productivity gain targets to establish measurable problem significance. Customer segmentation uses detailed characteristics including company size (50-500 employees), team size (5-15 developers), and role responsibilities to ensure precise problem targeting. The validation framework implements systematic criteria evaluation covering problem scope, language accuracy, evidence quality, and impact measurement to ensure comprehensive problem validation according to Amazon's customer-centric development standards.

########### Code Usage Examples

This example demonstrates the problem statement structure used in the Amazon Problem Definition Template, showing how to articulate customer problems with specific context and quantified impact. The structure emphasizes customer-centric language and measurable consequences for validation purposes.

```markdown
# Problem Statement Template
**Today, [Customer Segment] have to [Current Limitation] when [Triggering Situation].**

**This means [Quantified Impact], making it difficult to [Customer Goal].**

**These customers need [Solution Direction] so they can [Desired Outcome].**
```

This example shows the validation criteria framework referenced in the problem definition, demonstrating how to systematically validate problem definitions using Amazon's standards. The framework provides clear pass/fail criteria for comprehensive problem validation.

```markdown
# Problem Validation Framework
### Specificity Test: [✅/❌] [STATUS]
- Problem scope and solution completeness assessment
