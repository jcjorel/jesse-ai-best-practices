#### Functional Intent & Features

This file serves as the legal licensing document for the Jesse Framework MCP project, establishing the terms and conditions under which the software can be used, modified, and distributed. The license provides comprehensive legal protection and usage permissions through the widely-recognized `MIT License` framework, granting broad usage rights while maintaining copyright attribution requirements. Key semantic entities include `MIT License` as the specific licensing framework, `Copyright (c) 2025 Jean-Charles Jorel` establishing ownership and temporal scope, `Permission is hereby granted, free of charge` defining the cost-free usage model, `without restriction` clause providing comprehensive usage rights including `use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell`, `THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS"` disclaimer establishing warranty limitations, `WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND` comprehensive warranty exclusion, `EXPRESS OR IMPLIED` warranty type specifications, `MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT` specific warranty disclaimers, and `SHALL NOT BE LIABLE` liability limitation clauses covering `DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY` scenarios ensuring legal protection for the copyright holder while enabling unrestricted software usage and distribution.

##### Main Components

The license document contains four primary structural components establishing comprehensive legal framework coverage. The header section includes the `MIT License` title and `Copyright (c) 2025 Jean-Charles Jorel` ownership declaration establishing legal authority and temporal scope. The permissions section grants comprehensive usage rights through `Permission is hereby granted, free of charge` language covering software acquisition, modification, distribution, and commercial usage without financial obligations. The conditions section establishes mandatory requirements through `The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software` ensuring attribution preservation across all derivative works and distributions. The warranty disclaimer and liability limitation section provides comprehensive legal protection through `THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS"` declarations and explicit exclusions of warranties and liability coverage protecting the copyright holder from legal claims while maintaining user access rights.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements the standard `MIT License` template structure with precise legal language and comprehensive coverage of software usage scenarios. The design employs a hierarchical legal framework starting with copyright establishment, followed by permission grants, mandatory conditions, and protective disclaimers. The system uses standardized legal terminology and clause structures ensuring enforceability and recognition across international legal jurisdictions. The architectural pattern includes explicit permission enumeration covering all major software usage scenarios, mandatory attribution requirements preserving copyright acknowledgment, and comprehensive liability exclusions protecting against legal claims. The document structure follows established legal precedents with clear section delineation and unambiguous language ensuring legal clarity and enforceability.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses the standard `MIT License` template with specific customization for the Jesse Framework MCP project including copyright holder identification and year specification. The approach employs precise legal language with explicit enumeration of granted rights and required conditions ensuring comprehensive coverage of software usage scenarios. Legal protection mechanisms include warranty disclaimers using `EXPRESS OR IMPLIED` language covering all warranty types, liability limitations addressing `DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY` scenarios, and attribution requirements ensuring copyright preservation. The system implements standard legal formatting with capitalized disclaimer sections emphasizing critical legal protections and clear conditional language establishing mandatory requirements for license compliance.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The license addresses potential legal disputes through comprehensive warranty disclaimers and liability limitations covering all possible damage scenarios including `DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY`. Attribution compliance edge cases are handled through explicit requirements for copyright notice inclusion in `all copies or substantial portions of the Software` ensuring protection regardless of distribution method or derivative work scope. International legal jurisdiction variations are managed through the use of widely-recognized `MIT License` framework with established legal precedent and enforceability across multiple legal systems. Commercial usage scenarios receive explicit coverage through `sell copies of the Software` permissions eliminating ambiguity about monetization rights. The system handles partial software usage through `substantial portions` language ensuring attribution requirements apply to significant code reuse while providing flexibility for minor incorporations.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The license text uses standardized legal formatting with specific capitalization patterns for emphasis including `THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS"` and `WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND` ensuring legal significance and enforceability. Copyright specification includes precise temporal scope with `2025` year designation and specific copyright holder identification through `Jean-Charles Jorel` attribution. Permission enumeration uses comprehensive language covering `use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell` ensuring complete usage right specification. Warranty disclaimer implementation employs both `EXPRESS OR IMPLIED` categories with specific exclusions for `MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT` covering all standard warranty types. Liability limitation uses broad language covering `ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY` with multiple legal theory coverage including `CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE` ensuring comprehensive protection.

########### Code Usage Examples

This example demonstrates the standard license header format that should be included in source code files to ensure proper attribution and license compliance. The header provides essential copyright and license information for legal protection and compliance verification.

```text
# Copyright (c) 2025 Jean-Charles Jorel
# Licensed under the MIT License
# See LICENSE file in the project root for full license text
```

This example shows the package metadata configuration for including license information in Python package distributions. The license specification ensures proper legal compliance and attribution in package management systems.

```python
# Package setup configuration with MIT License specification for distribution compliance
setup(
    name="jesse-framework-mcp",
    license="MIT",
    license_files=["LICENSE"],
    # Additional package metadata
)
```

This example illustrates the documentation reference pattern for linking to the license file in project documentation. The reference ensures users can easily access complete license terms and understand their usage rights and obligations.

```markdown
# License reference in project documentation for user guidance and legal compliance
