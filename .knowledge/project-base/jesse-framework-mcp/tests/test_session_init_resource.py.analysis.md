#### Functional Intent & Features

This test script validates the `jesse://session/init-context` meta-resource functionality within the JESSE Framework MCP Server, specifically designed to verify comprehensive session initialization for Cline IDE integration. The script provides automated testing capabilities for multi-section HTTP response validation, resource aggregation verification, and individual component isolation testing. Key semantic entities include `get_session_init_context`, `TestContext` class, `unwrap_fastmcp_function` utility, `asyncio` async execution, `fastmcp.Context` integration, and `jesse_framework_mcp.resources` module imports. The testing framework implements progress reporting through emoji-based status indicators and detailed section analysis with criticality level validation (`CRITICAL`, `INFORMATIONAL`).

##### Main Components

The script contains three primary async functions: `test_session_init_resource()` for comprehensive meta-resource testing, `test_individual_sections()` for isolated component validation, and `main()` for orchestrated test execution. A custom `TestContext` class provides mock context implementation with logging methods (`info`, `error`, `warning`, `debug`, `report_progress`). The testing logic includes result analysis functionality for HTTP section counting, key section verification against expected patterns, and sample output display for debugging purposes.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture follows an async testing pattern with mock context injection and progressive validation layers. The design implements separation of concerns through individual section testing followed by comprehensive integration testing. Error handling is structured with graceful degradation and detailed traceback reporting. The testing framework uses a hierarchical approach where individual components are validated before testing the complete meta-resource aggregation functionality.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses `unwrap_fastmcp_function()` to handle FastMCP decorator removal before function execution, enabling direct async function calls. Section verification employs pattern matching against predefined tuples containing section identifiers, criticality levels, and display names. Progress reporting utilizes percentage calculation for visual feedback during resource loading. The testing strategy implements both positive path validation and error isolation through individual component testing with exception handling and traceback capture.

**‚ö° System role and ecosystem integration:**
- **System Role**: Validation gateway ensuring session initialization meta-resource reliability before Cline IDE deployment
- **Ecosystem Position**: Critical testing component for MCP server resource protocol compliance and multi-section HTTP response validation
- **Integration Pattern**: Executed by developers and CI/CD systems to verify resource aggregation functionality and individual component isolation

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

Error handling covers FastMCP function unwrapping failures, missing resource sections, empty result responses, and individual component failures. The script handles `KeyboardInterrupt` for graceful user termination and captures unexpected exceptions with full traceback reporting. Edge cases include missing criticality markers in HTTP responses, zero-length resource sections, and module import failures during individual section testing. The testing framework provides detailed error context through emoji-based status indicators and section-by-section failure isolation.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The `TestContext` class implements all required context methods as simple print statements with emoji prefixes for visual debugging. Section verification uses string containment checks with case-insensitive matching for robustness. The result analysis calculates character counts, HTTP section counts using `Content-Type:` markers, and displays truncated sample output for manual inspection. Individual section testing uses dynamic module imports with `__import__` and `getattr` for flexible function resolution.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Basic test execution for session initialization validation:**
```python
# Execute comprehensive session initialization test
success = await test_session_init_resource()
if success:
    print("Session initialization meta-resource validated successfully")
```

**Individual component testing for debugging:**
```python
# Test specific resource sections in isolation
await test_individual_sections()
# Validates framework rules, project context, WIP tasks, and knowledge indexes separately
```

**Custom context implementation for testing:**
```python
class TestContext:
    async def info(self, message):
        print(f"‚ÑπÔ∏è  {message}")
    async def report_progress(self, current, total, message):
        percentage = (current / total) * 100
        print(f"üìä [{percentage:3.0f}%] {message}")
```
