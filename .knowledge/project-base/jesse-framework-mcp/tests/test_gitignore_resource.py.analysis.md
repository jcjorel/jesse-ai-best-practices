#### Functional Intent & Features

This test script validates the `jesse://project/gitignore-files` MCP resource functionality, providing comprehensive testing of gitignore file discovery and HTTP-formatted response generation within the JESSE Framework MCP Server. The script enables developers to verify proper resource behavior, boundary marker formatting, and writable content flag functionality through automated testing workflows that examine `get_project_gitignore_files()` resource function, `unwrap_fastmcp_function()` utility, and `MockContext` simulation patterns. Key semantic entities include `asyncio` event loop management, `pathlib.Path` operations, `project_resources` module integration, `JESSE_FRAMEWORK_BOUNDARY_2025` HTTP boundaries, `Content-Writable: true` headers, `Content-Section: gitignore-file` markers, and directory-specific gitignore validation for Project Root, Coding Assistant Artifacts, Knowledge Management System, and Project-Specific Rules sections.

##### Main Components

The script contains two primary async test functions: `test_gitignore_resource()` which creates a `MockContext` class with `info()` and `error()` logging methods, unwraps the FastMCP decorated function, executes the gitignore resource, and validates response structure through boundary counting and section verification; and `main()` which handles test orchestration, working directory setup, and exit code management. Supporting components include the `MockContext` class providing async logging interface simulation with message collection capabilities, directory validation logic for specific gitignore categories, and comprehensive response verification mechanisms checking HTTP boundary markers, writable headers, and content sections.

###### Architecture & Design

The script follows a mock-based testing architecture with clear separation between resource function testing and response validation logic. The design implements a lightweight context simulation pattern using `MockContext` class that mirrors the actual MCP server context interface without requiring full server initialization. The architecture supports comprehensive response structure validation through systematic counting of HTTP boundaries, content headers, and section markers, with working directory management ensuring tests execute from the correct project root context for accurate gitignore file discovery.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses FastMCP function unwrapping through `unwrap_fastmcp_function()` utility to enable direct testing of decorated resource functions without MCP server overhead. The script employs systematic response validation using string counting methods for `JESSE_FRAMEWORK_BOUNDARY_2025` boundaries, `Content-Writable: true` headers, and `Content-Section` markers to verify proper HTTP formatting. Key technical strategies include working directory manipulation via `os.chdir()` for project root context, message collection through `MockContext.messages` list for debugging, and comprehensive section validation checking for specific directory categories within gitignore responses.

######## Code Usage Examples

Execute comprehensive gitignore resource testing with detailed validation output:

```python
# Run the complete gitignore resource test suite
python test_gitignore_resource.py

# Expected output includes boundary marker counting, writable header validation,
# and directory-specific section verification for all gitignore categories
```

Test individual resource function behavior programmatically:

```python
from utils import unwrap_fastmcp_function
from jesse_framework_mcp.resources import project_resources

# Unwrap and test the gitignore resource function directly
unwrapped_function = unwrap_fastmcp_function(project_resources.get_project_gitignore_files)
result = await unwrapped_function(mock_context)
```

Validate response structure components for debugging:

```python
# Check HTTP boundary formatting and content sections
boundary_count = result.count("--JESSE_FRAMEWORK_BOUNDARY_2025--")
writable_count = result.count("Content-Writable: true")
gitignore_sections = result.count("Content-Section: gitignore-file")
```

######### External Dependencies & Integration Points

**→ Inbound:**
- `jesse_framework_mcp.resources.project_resources` - gitignore resource function (`get_project_gitignore_files`)
- `utils.py` - FastMCP function unwrapping utility (`unwrap_fastmcp_function`)
- `asyncio` (stdlib) - async test execution and event loop management
- `pathlib.Path` (stdlib) - filesystem path operations and working directory resolution
- `os` (stdlib) - working directory manipulation and environment access
- `sys` (stdlib) - Python path modification for module imports

**← Outbound:**
- `console/terminal` - formatted test output with emoji indicators and validation results
- `exit codes` - process exit status (0 for success, 1 for failure)
- `working directory` - project root context setup for accurate resource testing
- `MockContext.messages` - collected logging messages for debugging and verification

**⚡ Integration:**
- Protocol: Direct function imports and async function calls with mock context simulation
- Interface: Async test functions with FastMCP resource integration and HTTP response validation
- Coupling: Tight coupling to JESSE Framework MCP resources, loose coupling to external environment

########## Edge Cases & Error Handling

The script handles missing or inaccessible gitignore files through comprehensive error section counting using `Content-Section: gitignore-error` markers in response validation. Error handling includes exception catching in the main test execution flow with detailed error reporting and context message collection for debugging failed resource calls. The script addresses scenarios where FastMCP function unwrapping fails, working directory changes are unsuccessful, and resource responses contain malformed HTTP boundaries or missing content sections through systematic validation checks and clear failure reporting.

########### Internal Implementation Details

The script uses `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent))` for dynamic module path resolution, enabling test execution from various directory contexts without installation requirements. The `MockContext` class implements message collection through `self.messages` list with formatted logging output using emoji indicators for visual test result identification. Internal mechanics include working directory manipulation via `os.chdir(Path(__file__).parent.parent)` to ensure project root context, systematic string counting for HTTP response validation, and exit code management using `exit(0)` for success and `exit(1)` for failure states. The validation logic uses specific directory name matching for "Project Root Directory", "Coding Assistant Artifacts", "Knowledge Management System", and "Project-Specific Rules" sections to verify comprehensive gitignore coverage.
