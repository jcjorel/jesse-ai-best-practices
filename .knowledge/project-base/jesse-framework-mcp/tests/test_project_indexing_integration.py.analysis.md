#### Functional Intent & Features

This file provides comprehensive integration testing for the JESSE Framework Knowledge Bases Hierarchical Indexing System, validating real-world project indexing functionality with actual file structures and complexity. The file executes end-to-end testing of the indexing pipeline through `test_real_project_indexing()` function that processes the actual JESSE Framework project root, capturing all messages and analyzing results for success determination. Key semantic entities include `HierarchicalIndexer` for core indexing operations, `IndexingConfig` with `IndexingMode.INCREMENTAL` for configuration management, `MockContext` for FastMCP context simulation, `ensure_project_root()` for dynamic project detection, `ProcessingStatus` for operation state tracking, and `asyncio` for asynchronous execution coordination. The testing architecture validates real-world indexing performance through comprehensive error monitoring, debug artifact generation, and success criteria analysis with detailed statistics reporting.

##### Main Components

The file contains two primary components: `MockContext` class provides FastMCP Context simulation with message categorization (`info_messages`, `debug_messages`, `warning_messages`, `error_messages`) and real-time progress monitoring, and `test_real_project_indexing()` function executes comprehensive integration testing with project structure analysis, indexing execution, and result validation. Supporting functions include `main()` for test orchestration and execution coordination. Each component focuses on specific integration testing aspects, providing comprehensive coverage of indexing system functionality, error detection, and performance analysis with real project complexity.

###### Architecture & Design

The integration test architecture follows a comprehensive validation pattern with clear separation between context simulation and indexing execution. `MockContext` implements the FastMCP Context interface with message capture and real-time display functionality, enabling detailed analysis of indexing operations. The main test function employs a multi-phase approach: project root detection with error handling, configuration setup with conservative parameters, project structure analysis with file counting, indexing execution with comprehensive monitoring, and result analysis with success criteria evaluation. The design emphasizes real-world testing conditions, comprehensive error capture, and detailed reporting for clear pass/fail determination.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation utilizes `ensure_project_root()` for dynamic project detection with comprehensive error handling for missing project environments. Configuration management employs `IndexingConfig` with conservative settings (`max_concurrent_operations=1`, `batch_size=5`, `continue_on_file_errors=True`) to ensure stable testing conditions. Project structure analysis iterates through directories using `should_process_directory()` and `should_process_file()` filters to provide accurate processing estimates. Debug artifact management creates temporary directories (`/tmp/jesse_project_indexing_integration_test`) with comprehensive cleanup and preservation for post-test analysis. Success determination employs multi-criteria evaluation including completion status, file processing rates, message analysis, and debug artifact generation.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

Error handling includes project root detection failures with `ValueError` for missing project environments and generic `Exception` handling for unexpected detection errors. Configuration validation handles invalid parameters with descriptive error messages and fallback to conservative defaults. Indexing execution employs comprehensive exception handling with detailed error capture, message analysis, and partial result reporting even during failures. File processing errors are handled through `continue_on_file_errors=True` configuration, allowing individual file failures without stopping overall indexing. Success criteria evaluation accommodates partial failures with configurable thresholds (50% success rate minimum) and comprehensive error categorization for detailed failure analysis.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The implementation uses `datetime.now()` for precise timing measurements and duration calculations throughout indexing operations. Message capture employs separate lists for different message types with real-time `print()` statements for visual progress monitoring. Debug directory management uses `shutil.rmtree()` for cleanup and `mkdir(parents=True)` for creation with comprehensive error handling. File counting utilizes `rglob("*")` for recursive directory traversal with filtering through configuration methods. Success criteria evaluation employs dictionary-based validation with boolean logic and percentage calculations for comprehensive pass/fail determination. Debug artifact preservation maintains all generated files for post-test analysis and troubleshooting.

########### Code Usage Examples

Basic integration test execution demonstrates the complete testing workflow from project detection through result analysis. This pattern provides comprehensive validation of the indexing system with real project complexity.

```python
# Complete integration test execution with comprehensive monitoring
async def test_real_project_indexing():
    project_root = ensure_project_root()
    config = IndexingConfig(
        indexing_mode=IndexingMode.INCREMENTAL,
        enable_project_base_indexing=True,
        debug_mode=True,
        max_concurrent_operations=1
    )
    ctx = MockContext()
    indexer = HierarchicalIndexer(config)
    result = await indexer.index_hierarchy(project_root, ctx)
    return result.overall_status == ProcessingStatus.COMPLETED
```

MockContext implementation demonstrates FastMCP Context interface simulation with comprehensive message capture and real-time monitoring capabilities.

```python
# FastMCP Context simulation with message categorization and monitoring
class MockContext:
    def __init__(self):
        self.info_messages = []
        self.error_messages = []
    
    async def info(self, message: str) -> None:
        self.info_messages.append(message)
        print(f"INFO: {message}")
    
    async def error(self, message: str) -> None:
        self.error_messages.append(message)
        print(f"ERROR: {message}")
```

Success criteria evaluation demonstrates comprehensive validation logic with multiple criteria and detailed reporting for clear pass/fail determination.

```python
# Multi-criteria success evaluation with detailed analysis
success_criteria = {
    "Indexing completed": result.overall_status == ProcessingStatus.COMPLETED,
    "Files discovered": stats.total_files_discovered > 0,
    "Some files processed": stats.files_processed > 0,
    "No critical failure": len(ctx.error_messages) < stats.total_files_discovered
}
integration_success = all(success_criteria.values()) and files_success_rate > 50
```
