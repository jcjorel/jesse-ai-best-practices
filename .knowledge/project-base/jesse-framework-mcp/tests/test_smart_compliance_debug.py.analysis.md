#### Functional Intent & Features

This file provides isolated debugging capabilities for the `get_gitignore_compliance_status` function within the Jesse Framework MCP server, specifically testing the smart compliance detection mechanism. The debug test validates that the `get_gitignore_compliance_status` function from `jesse_framework_mcp.resources.gitignore` can be properly imported, unwrapped via `unwrap_fastmcp_function`, and executed to detect gitignore compliance violations. Key semantic entities include `DebugContext` class, `debug_smart_compliance` async function, `get_gitignore_compliance_status` MCP resource function, `unwrap_fastmcp_function` utility, `asyncio` event loop management, and comprehensive error handling with `traceback` analysis. The test implements a structured validation approach using emoji-based status indicators (‚úÖ, ‚ùå, ‚ö†Ô∏è, üìä) for clear visual feedback during debugging sessions.

##### Main Components

The file contains three primary components: the `DebugContext` class that provides mock logging context with `info` and `error` methods for testing isolation, the `debug_smart_compliance` async function that orchestrates the complete testing workflow, and the main execution block using `asyncio.run` for direct script execution. The `DebugContext` simulates the MCP server context interface required by the compliance function, while `debug_smart_compliance` performs sequential validation steps including function import verification, unwrapping validation, execution testing, and result analysis with detailed output formatting.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture follows a test isolation pattern that decouples the compliance function from the full MCP server context, enabling focused debugging without server infrastructure dependencies. The design implements a mock context pattern through `DebugContext` to satisfy the function's interface requirements, while the sequential testing approach provides step-by-step validation with clear success/failure indicators. The structure separates concerns between context mocking, function testing, and result analysis, allowing developers to identify specific failure points in the compliance detection pipeline.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses async/await patterns throughout to match the MCP server's asynchronous execution model, with `unwrap_fastmcp_function` handling the FastMCP framework's function decoration layer. The testing strategy employs progressive validation steps with immediate feedback, comprehensive exception handling using `traceback.print_exc()` for detailed error diagnosis, and result analysis including type inspection, length measurement, and content preview. The approach prioritizes developer experience through emoji-based visual indicators and structured output formatting that clearly distinguishes between different test phases and outcomes.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**‚Üí Inbound:**
- `jesse_framework_mcp.resources.gitignore:get_gitignore_compliance_status` - core compliance detection function being tested
- `utils:unwrap_fastmcp_function` - utility for unwrapping FastMCP decorated functions
- `asyncio` (external library) - Python async event loop management
- `traceback` (external library) - Python exception stack trace analysis

**‚Üê Outbound:**
- Direct script execution via `python test_smart_compliance_debug.py` - standalone debugging tool
- Console output for developer debugging sessions - formatted test results and error diagnostics

**‚ö° System role and ecosystem integration:**
- **System Role**: Serves as an isolated testing harness for the Jesse Framework MCP server's gitignore compliance detection functionality, enabling developers to debug compliance issues without full server startup
- **Ecosystem Position**: Peripheral debugging tool that validates core MCP resource functionality outside the main server execution context
- **Integration Pattern**: Used by developers during debugging sessions to isolate and test the `get_gitignore_compliance_status` function, particularly when troubleshooting compliance detection failures or validating function behavior changes

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The debug script handles multiple error scenarios including import failures when `get_gitignore_compliance_status` or `unwrap_fastmcp_function` are unavailable, unwrapping failures if the FastMCP decoration is incompatible, execution failures during compliance function runtime, and context interface mismatches between `DebugContext` and expected MCP context. The comprehensive exception handling uses `traceback.print_exc()` to provide full stack traces for debugging, while the sequential testing approach isolates failure points to specific operations. Result validation includes empty string detection for no compliance issues versus content detection for compliance violations, with type and length analysis for unexpected return formats.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The `DebugContext` class implements a minimal interface with async `info` and `error` methods that print formatted messages, satisfying the compliance function's logging requirements without full MCP context overhead. The main debugging function uses structured print statements with emoji prefixes for visual parsing, implements try-catch around the entire testing sequence to prevent script termination, and performs detailed result analysis including `type()`, `len()`, and `repr()` inspection. The script uses `if __name__ == "__main__"` pattern for direct execution while maintaining importability, and the `asyncio.run()` call handles the async context management for the debugging session.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Direct script execution for debugging compliance detection:**
```python
# Run the debug script directly to test compliance function
python test_smart_compliance_debug.py
```

**Expected output format for successful compliance testing:**
```python
# Console output showing test progression
=== DEBUGGING SMART COMPLIANCE ===
1. Testing function import...
‚úÖ Function imported and unwrapped successfully
2. Testing function execution...
‚úÖ Function executed successfully
üìä Result type: <class 'str'>
üìä Result length: 0 chars
üìä Result preview: ''
‚úÖ No compliance issues - function returned empty string
```

**Integration pattern for testing compliance function in isolation:**
```python
# Example of how the debug script isolates and tests the compliance function
compliance_func = unwrap_fastmcp_function(get_gitignore_compliance_status)
result = await compliance_func(ctx)
# Provides detailed analysis without full MCP server context
```
