#### Functional Intent & Features

This debug test script validates the `get_gitignore_compliance_status` function isolation within the JESSE Framework MCP Server, specifically designed to test smart compliance functionality through direct function execution and debugging. The script provides isolated testing capabilities for gitignore compliance checking, function unwrapping validation, and detailed result analysis with comprehensive error reporting. Key semantic entities include `get_gitignore_compliance_status`, `debug_smart_compliance`, `DebugContext`, `unwrap_fastmcp_function`, `asyncio` async execution, `traceback` error reporting, and console output formatting with emoji-based status indicators. The debugging framework implements two-phase validation through function import/unwrapping verification and direct execution testing with detailed result inspection and compliance status interpretation.

##### Main Components

The script contains two primary components: `DebugContext` class providing simplified logging functionality with `info` and `error` methods for console output, and `debug_smart_compliance` async function implementing comprehensive function testing and validation. The main execution block uses `asyncio.run()` for direct script execution. The debug function implements sequential testing phases including function import verification, unwrapping validation, execution testing, and result analysis with detailed output formatting and error handling.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture follows a focused debugging pattern with isolated function testing through direct import and execution validation, utilizing simplified context mocking for dependency injection. The design implements comprehensive error handling through try-catch blocks with detailed traceback reporting and console output formatting. Testing validation is structured with sequential phases and detailed result inspection including type analysis, length measurement, and content preview. The debugging framework uses emoji-based status indicators combined with detailed console output for clear test result visualization.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses direct function import from `jesse_framework_mcp.resources.gitignore` module and function unwrapping through `unwrap_fastmcp_function` utility for FastMCP decorator removal. Context mocking employs simple class definition with async logging methods for dependency satisfaction. Result analysis implements comprehensive inspection including type checking, content length measurement, and preview generation with string representation. The testing strategy uses sequential validation phases with detailed console output and error isolation through exception handling with full traceback capture.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**‚Üí Inbound:**
- `jesse_framework_mcp.resources.gitignore:get_gitignore_compliance_status` - primary compliance checking function
- `utils:unwrap_fastmcp_function` - FastMCP decorator removal utility
- `asyncio` (external library) - async execution framework
- `traceback` (external library) - error reporting and stack trace generation

**‚Üê Outbound:**
- Console debug output with detailed function testing results
- Compliance status validation for gitignore configuration verification
- Error reporting for debugging failed compliance checks

**‚ö° System role and ecosystem integration:**
- **System Role**: Isolated debugging utility for gitignore compliance function validation within the JESSE Framework MCP Server testing ecosystem
- **Ecosystem Position**: Auxiliary debugging tool for compliance function isolation, supporting development and troubleshooting of gitignore resource functionality
- **Integration Pattern**: Executed manually by developers for debugging compliance function behavior, providing detailed inspection of function execution and result analysis for troubleshooting

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

Error handling covers function import failures with detailed error reporting, FastMCP unwrapping errors with traceback capture, and function execution failures with comprehensive exception handling. The script handles missing dependencies through import error catching and provides detailed error context through `traceback.print_exc()` for debugging support. Edge cases include empty result handling with compliance status interpretation, function execution timeouts, and context dependency failures. The debugging framework provides comprehensive error scenario coverage through exception catching and detailed console output for troubleshooting failed compliance checks.

########## Internal Implementation Details

Function testing uses direct import and unwrapping through `unwrap_fastmcp_function` utility for decorator removal before execution. Context mocking implements simple async methods with formatted console output using emoji prefixes for visual debugging. Result analysis employs comprehensive inspection including `type()` checking, `len()` measurement, and `repr()` preview generation with string slicing for content examination. Error reporting uses `traceback.print_exc()` for full stack trace capture and detailed exception information display.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Basic compliance function debugging with unwrapping:**

This example demonstrates how to debug the gitignore compliance function through direct import and unwrapping. The test validates that the function can be imported and unwrapped successfully before execution.

```python
# Debug compliance function import and unwrapping
compliance_func = unwrap_fastmcp_function(get_gitignore_compliance_status)
print("‚úÖ Function imported and unwrapped successfully")
result = await compliance_func(ctx)
print(f"üìä Result type: {type(result)}")
```

**Comprehensive result analysis with detailed inspection:**

This snippet shows how to analyze compliance function results with detailed inspection and status interpretation. The analysis includes type checking, content measurement, and compliance status determination.

```python
# Analyze compliance function results with detailed inspection
print(f"üìä Result length: {len(result)} chars")
print(f"üìä Result preview: {repr(result[:200])}")
if result.strip():
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è Compliance issues detected - function returned content")
else:
    print("‚úÖ No compliance issues - function returned empty string")
```

**Error handling with comprehensive traceback reporting:**

This example demonstrates how to handle errors during compliance function testing with detailed error reporting. The error handling provides full traceback information for debugging failed compliance checks.

```python
# Handle errors with comprehensive traceback reporting
try:
    result = await compliance_func(ctx)
    print(f"‚úÖ Function executed successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"‚ùå Error in smart compliance: {e}")
    import traceback
    traceback.print_exc()
    return None
```
