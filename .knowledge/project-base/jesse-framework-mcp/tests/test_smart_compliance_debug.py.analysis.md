#### Functional Intent & Features

Provides isolated debugging functionality for the smart compliance system within the JESSE Framework MCP Server, specifically targeting the `get_gitignore_compliance_status` function for direct testing and validation. Enables developers to debug compliance function behavior outside of the full MCP server context through direct function invocation and detailed result inspection. Delivers comprehensive debugging output including function import verification, execution status, result type analysis, and content preview for troubleshooting compliance detection issues. Key semantic entities include `get_gitignore_compliance_status` function from `jesse_framework_mcp.resources.gitignore`, `unwrap_fastmcp_function` utility from `utils` module, `DebugContext` class providing async logging methods, `debug_smart_compliance()` main debugging function, `asyncio` for async execution, and detailed result inspection with type checking, length measurement, and content preview capabilities.

##### Main Components

Contains two primary components: `DebugContext` class providing simplified async logging interface with `info()` and `error()` methods for debugging output, and `debug_smart_compliance()` async function implementing the main debugging workflow. The debugging function performs sequential validation steps including function import verification, FastMCP function unwrapping, execution testing, and comprehensive result analysis. The main execution block uses `asyncio.run()` to execute the debugging workflow when the script runs directly.

###### Architecture & Design

Implements lightweight debugging architecture with minimal dependencies and direct function testing approach. Uses simplified context object pattern through `DebugContext` class to provide required async logging interface without full MCP server overhead. Employs sequential testing methodology with clear step-by-step validation and detailed status reporting. Separates function import testing from execution testing to isolate potential failure points and provide specific error context for debugging purposes.

####### Implementation Approach

Debugging strategy uses direct function import and unwrapping through `unwrap_fastmcp_function()` utility to access the underlying compliance function. Function execution employs async context pattern with simplified `DebugContext` providing required logging interface. Result analysis includes comprehensive inspection of return value type, content length, and preview of actual content for debugging purposes. Error handling uses try-catch blocks with detailed exception reporting and stack trace printing for comprehensive debugging information.

######## Code Usage Examples

Execute the smart compliance debugging script directly. This provides comprehensive debugging output for the gitignore compliance function:

```bash
# Run smart compliance debugging
python test_smart_compliance_debug.py
```

Test function import and unwrapping manually. This demonstrates how to access and prepare the compliance function for testing:

```python
# Test function import and unwrapping
from jesse_framework_mcp.resources.gitignore import get_gitignore_compliance_status
from utils import unwrap_fastmcp_function
compliance_func = unwrap_fastmcp_function(get_gitignore_compliance_status)
```

Execute compliance function with debug context. This shows how to run the compliance function with simplified logging context:

```python
# Execute compliance function with debug context
ctx = DebugContext()
result = await compliance_func(ctx)
print(f"Result type: {type(result)}")
print(f"Result length: {len(result)} chars")
```

######### External Dependencies & Integration Points

**→ Inbound:**
- `jesse_framework_mcp.resources.gitignore:get_gitignore_compliance_status` - main compliance function under test
- `utils:unwrap_fastmcp_function` - utility for extracting underlying function from FastMCP wrapper
- `asyncio` (standard library) - async execution framework for debugging workflow
- `traceback` (standard library) - exception stack trace printing for debugging

**← Outbound:**
- `console/stdout` - debugging output and status reporting with emoji indicators
- `development workflows/` - debugging support for compliance function development
- `testing pipelines/` - isolated function testing for compliance validation

**⚡ Integration:**
- Protocol: Direct Python imports with async function execution
- Interface: Function calls, async context objects, and console output
- Coupling: Tight coupling with compliance function and utils module, loose coupling with external systems

########## Edge Cases & Error Handling

Handles function import failures through try-catch blocks with detailed error reporting and stack trace printing. Manages FastMCP function unwrapping errors by catching exceptions during the unwrapping process and providing specific error context. Addresses function execution failures with comprehensive exception handling including error message printing and traceback output. Provides graceful handling of result analysis failures and validates that debugging continues even when individual steps fail. Implements detailed status reporting with emoji indicators for immediate visual feedback on debugging progress.

########### Internal Implementation Details

Uses emoji-based status reporting (✅, ❌, ⚠️) for immediate visual feedback during debugging execution with detailed step-by-step progress tracking. Implements comprehensive result analysis including type inspection, content length measurement, and preview generation for debugging purposes. Employs simplified context object pattern with `DebugContext` class providing minimal async logging interface required by compliance function. Result interpretation logic analyzes whether compliance issues were detected based on empty vs non-empty return values. Exception handling includes full stack trace printing through `traceback.print_exc()` for comprehensive debugging information.
