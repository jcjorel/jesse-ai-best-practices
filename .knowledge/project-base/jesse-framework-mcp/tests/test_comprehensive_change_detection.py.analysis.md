#### Functional Intent & Features

This test script validates comprehensive change detection enhancements for the JESSE Framework knowledge building system, specifically testing constituent dependency checking for directory knowledge files through multi-layered staleness detection. The script provides validation of cache-first processing, timestamp-based freshness checking, hierarchical dependency propagation, and performance optimization for knowledge base rebuilding decisions. Key semantic entities include `FileAnalysisCache`, `ChangeDetector`, `IndexingConfig`, `DirectoryContext`, `FileContext`, `ProcessingStatus`, `MockContext`, `test_file_analysis_cache_staleness_checking()`, `test_detailed_staleness_info()`, `test_change_detector_enhancements()`, `test_realistic_change_scenarios()`, `test_performance_optimization()`, `is_knowledge_file_stale()`, `get_constituent_staleness_info()`, `check_comprehensive_directory_change()`, `get_detailed_change_analysis()`, `get_knowledge_file_path()`, `timestamp_tolerance_seconds`, `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`, `asyncio` async execution, and `.knowledge/` directory structure. The testing framework enables developers to verify that knowledge base rebuilding occurs only when necessary, reducing computational overhead while maintaining content accuracy through intelligent dependency tracking.

##### Main Components

The script contains five primary async test functions: `test_file_analysis_cache_staleness_checking()` for validating comprehensive staleness detection methods, `test_detailed_staleness_info()` for testing detailed staleness information gathering, `test_change_detector_enhancements()` for enhanced ChangeDetector functionality validation, `test_realistic_change_scenarios()` for development workflow simulation, and `test_performance_optimization()` for performance benefit measurement. The `MockContext` class provides logging simulation with message tracking, while `create_directory_context()` helper function creates realistic DirectoryContext instances for testing. The `run_all_tests()` function orchestrates sequential test execution with comprehensive result reporting and performance metrics tracking.

###### Architecture & Design

The test architecture follows a multi-layered validation pattern where change detection is tested at multiple dependency levels: source files, cached analyses, subdirectory knowledge files, and hierarchical propagation. The design implements comprehensive scenario testing using realistic project structures with multiple directories, files, and dependency relationships. The script uses temporary directory isolation with `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` for clean test environments and controlled timestamp manipulation for precise staleness testing. Error handling is implemented through assertion-based validation with detailed diagnostic output for debugging change detection logic and dependency tracking issues.

####### Implementation Approach

The testing strategy employs controlled timestamp manipulation using `time.sleep()` delays and `timestamp_tolerance_seconds=0.05` for precise staleness detection testing. Change detection validation uses realistic file structure creation with JavaScript/TypeScript components, Python modules, and test files to simulate authentic development scenarios. Staleness checking implements multi-level dependency validation including source file timestamps, cached analysis freshness, and subdirectory knowledge file relationships. Performance testing creates moderate-sized project structures with multiple directories and files to measure change detection efficiency and optimization benefits.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The script handles multiple edge cases including missing knowledge files (treated as stale requiring rebuild), timestamp tolerance boundary conditions with `timestamp_tolerance_seconds=0.05`, concurrent file modifications during processing, hierarchical dependency chain validation failures, and performance degradation scenarios with large project structures. Exception handling includes comprehensive error catching with detailed diagnostic output for staleness detection failures, change propagation issues, and integration problems. The testing framework provides graceful handling of temporary directory cleanup failures and validates change detection behavior when multiple dependency layers are modified simultaneously. Individual test isolation ensures that failures in one change detection scenario do not prevent execution of subsequent validation tests.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The test functions implement emoji-based status reporting using Unicode characters (`‚úÖ`, `‚ùå`, `üéâ`, `üí•`, `üß™`, `üìä`) for immediate visual feedback on change detection behavior. Staleness validation includes direct file system verification of knowledge file creation, timestamp comparison with configurable tolerance, and multi-level dependency checking across source files, cached analyses, and subdirectory knowledge files. Mock context implementation tracks all logging messages for validation and provides structured output for debugging change detection logic. The script uses controlled timing with precise delays and realistic project structure simulation to test authentic development workflow scenarios.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Comprehensive staleness checking with multi-level dependencies:**

This code demonstrates the fundamental approach for testing FileAnalysisCache staleness detection with constituent dependencies. It validates that knowledge files are correctly identified as stale when cached analyses or subdirectory knowledge files are newer.

```python
# Test comprehensive staleness checking with constituent dependencies
config = IndexingConfig(timestamp_tolerance_seconds=0.05)
cache = FileAnalysisCache(config)

file_contexts = [FileContext(file_path=file1, file_size=file1.stat().st_size, 
                           last_modified=datetime.fromtimestamp(file1.stat().st_mtime))]

is_stale, reason = cache.is_knowledge_file_stale(
    source_root / "src", source_root, file_contexts
)
assert is_stale == True, "Should be stale when knowledge file missing"
```

**Enhanced change detection with hierarchical dependency propagation:**

This pattern tests ChangeDetector enhancements for comprehensive directory change checking with subdirectory dependencies. It validates that changes in subdirectory knowledge files correctly propagate to parent directory staleness detection.

```python
# Test enhanced change detection with hierarchical dependencies
detector = ChangeDetector(config)
directory_context = DirectoryContext(
    directory_path=source_root / "app",
    file_contexts=file_contexts
)

change_info = await detector.check_comprehensive_directory_change(
    directory_context, source_root, ctx
)
assert change_info.change_type.value == "new", "Should detect NEW change type"
```

**Realistic development scenario simulation with layered processing:**

This approach demonstrates testing realistic change scenarios that occur during development workflows. It validates that source file modifications do not directly trigger knowledge rebuilds, maintaining proper layered processing architecture.

```python
# Test realistic development scenario with layered processing validation
component_file.write_text("export default function Header() { return 'updated'; }")
components_context = create_directory_context(
    source_root / "src" / "components", [component_file], []
)

change_info = await detector.check_comprehensive_directory_change(
    components_context, source_root, ctx
)
assert change_info is None, "Source file changes should not directly trigger rebuilds"
```
