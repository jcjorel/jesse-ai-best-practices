#### Functional Intent & Features

Provides isolated debugging functionality for the smart compliance system within the JESSE Framework MCP Server, specifically targeting the `get_gitignore_compliance_status` function for direct testing and validation. Enables developers to debug compliance function behavior outside of the full MCP server context through function unwrapping, execution testing, and detailed result analysis. Delivers comprehensive debugging output including function import verification, execution status, result type analysis, and content preview for troubleshooting compliance detection issues. Key semantic entities include `get_gitignore_compliance_status` function from `jesse_framework_mcp.resources.gitignore`, `unwrap_fastmcp_function` utility from `utils` module, `DebugContext` class providing async logging methods, `debug_smart_compliance()` main debugging function, `asyncio` for async execution, and result analysis variables like `result`, `type(result)`, and `len(result)`.

##### Main Components

Contains two primary components: `DebugContext` class providing simplified async logging methods (`info()` and `error()`) that output directly to console, and `debug_smart_compliance()` async function that orchestrates the complete debugging workflow. The debugging function performs sequential operations including function import testing, FastMCP function unwrapping, execution with context, and comprehensive result analysis with type inspection and content preview.

###### Architecture & Design

Implements lightweight debugging architecture with minimal dependencies and direct console output for immediate feedback. Uses simplified context object pattern through `DebugContext` class that mimics the FastMCP context interface without full framework overhead. Employs sequential testing approach with explicit success/failure reporting at each stage to isolate potential issues. Separates function import, unwrapping, and execution phases to enable precise identification of failure points in the compliance system.

####### Implementation Approach

Debugging strategy uses direct function import and `unwrap_fastmcp_function()` utility to extract the underlying compliance function from FastMCP decorators. Execution testing creates minimal context object and invokes the unwrapped function with async/await pattern. Result analysis employs type inspection, length calculation, and string representation preview to understand function output characteristics. Error handling uses try-catch blocks with full traceback printing for comprehensive debugging information.

######## Code Usage Examples

Execute the smart compliance debugging script directly. This provides comprehensive debugging output for the gitignore compliance function:

```bash
# Run smart compliance debugging
python test_smart_compliance_debug.py
```

Test function unwrapping and execution manually. This demonstrates the core debugging workflow for compliance function isolation:

```python
# Debug compliance function manually
ctx = DebugContext()
compliance_func = unwrap_fastmcp_function(get_gitignore_compliance_status)
result = await compliance_func(ctx)
print(f"Result type: {type(result)}, Length: {len(result)}")
```

Analyze compliance function results with detailed inspection. This shows how to examine function output for debugging purposes:

```python
# Analyze compliance results
if result.strip():
    print("⚠️ Compliance issues detected - function returned content")
else:
    print("✅ No compliance issues - function returned empty string")
print(f"Preview: {repr(result[:200])}")
```

######### External Dependencies & Integration Points

**→ Inbound:**
- `asyncio` (standard library) - async execution framework for debugging workflow
- `jesse_framework_mcp.resources.gitignore:get_gitignore_compliance_status` - target compliance function for debugging
- `utils:unwrap_fastmcp_function` - utility for extracting functions from FastMCP decorators
- `traceback` (standard library) - error traceback printing for debugging

**← Outbound:**
- `console/stdout` - debugging output and analysis results
- `development workflows/` - debugging information for compliance system troubleshooting

**⚡ Integration:**
- Protocol: Direct Python imports with async function execution
- Interface: Function calls with context objects and result analysis
- Coupling: Loose coupling with minimal dependencies for isolated testing

########## Edge Cases & Error Handling

Handles function import failures through try-catch blocks with detailed error reporting and full traceback printing. Manages FastMCP function unwrapping errors by catching exceptions during the unwrapping process and providing specific error context. Addresses execution failures with comprehensive exception handling that preserves original error information while providing debugging context. Provides graceful handling of result analysis edge cases including empty results, None values, and unexpected result types through type checking and safe string operations.

########### Internal Implementation Details

Uses emoji-based status indicators (✅, ❌, ⚠️) for immediate visual feedback during debugging workflow execution. Implements sequential debugging phases with explicit success reporting at each stage to isolate failure points. Employs `repr()` function for safe string representation of results that handles special characters and control sequences. Result analysis uses string slicing with fixed preview length (200 characters) to provide meaningful content samples without overwhelming output. Error reporting combines exception messages with full traceback printing through `traceback.print_exc()` for comprehensive debugging information.
