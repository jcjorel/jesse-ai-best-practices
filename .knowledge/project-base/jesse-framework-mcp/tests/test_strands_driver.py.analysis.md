#### Functional Intent & Features

Provides comprehensive testing framework for the `StrandsClaude4Driver` within the JESSE Framework MCP Server, validating AWS Bedrock integration and conversation management capabilities. Enables independent verification of the `strands-agents` package integration through isolated test functions covering configuration validation, driver initialization, conversation lifecycle management, and caching system functionality. Delivers automated testing suite with detailed logging and error reporting for developers to validate Claude 4 Sonnet driver functionality before production deployment. Key semantic entities include `StrandsClaude4Driver` class, `Claude4SonnetConfig` configuration object, `ConversationMemoryStrategy` enum, `PromptCache` caching system, `asyncio` async execution framework, `logging` module for structured output, `strands-agents` external package, AWS Bedrock service integration, and environment variables `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

##### Main Components

Contains five primary test functions: `test_basic_configuration` for validating configuration creation and optimization presets, `test_driver_initialization` for testing context manager usage and cleanup, `test_conversation_management` for verifying conversation lifecycle operations, `test_mock_responses` for structural validation without API calls, and `test_caching_system` for independent cache functionality testing. Includes `run_all_tests` orchestration function that executes sequential test execution with comprehensive result reporting and `main` entry point function that performs environment validation and dependency checking before test execution.

###### Architecture & Design

Implements sequential test execution pattern with isolated test functions that can run independently or as part of the complete suite. Uses context manager pattern for proper resource cleanup and async/await throughout for consistent execution flow. Employs comprehensive logging strategy with structured output formatting and emoji-based visual indicators for immediate status recognition. Follows defensive programming approach with graceful degradation for missing dependencies and environment configuration issues.

####### Implementation Approach

Utilizes `asyncio.run()` for top-level async execution coordination and `async with` context managers for proper resource lifecycle management. Implements configuration testing through factory methods like `create_optimized_for_conversations()` and validation through exception handling for invalid parameters. Uses assertion-based validation for cache functionality testing and environment variable checking for AWS credential detection. Applies structured logging with timestamp formatting and hierarchical test result reporting with pass/fail statistics.

######## Code Usage Examples

Execute the complete test suite with environment validation and dependency checking. This approach provides comprehensive validation of all driver components with detailed reporting:

```bash
# Run all Strands driver tests with comprehensive reporting
python test_strands_driver.py
```

Test driver initialization with proper context management and cleanup. This pattern ensures proper resource lifecycle management during testing:

```python
# Initialize driver with optimized configuration and test conversation creation
config = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_performance()
async with StrandsClaude4Driver(config) as driver:
    conversation_id = "test_conversation_001"
    context = await driver.start_conversation(conversation_id)
    print(f"Started conversation: {context.conversation_id}")
```

Validate cache functionality with TTL expiration and eviction policies. This testing approach verifies cache behavior under various conditions:

```python
# Test prompt cache with expiration and size limits
cache = PromptCache(max_entries=3, ttl_seconds=1)
await cache.set("test prompt", "config_hash", "test response")
cached_response = await cache.get("test prompt", "config_hash")
assert cached_response == "test response"
```

########## Edge Cases & Error Handling

Handles missing `strands-agents` package gracefully with installation instructions and immediate exit to prevent cascade failures. Manages AWS credential absence through warning messages while allowing structural tests to continue execution. Addresses configuration validation through exception catching for invalid temperature values and other parameter constraints. Implements comprehensive exception handling at each test function level with detailed error context and traceback information. Provides fallback behavior for cache expiration testing with sleep delays and assertion-based validation of TTL functionality.

########### Internal Implementation Details

Uses emoji-based status reporting system with ✅ for success, ❌ for failures, and ⚠️ for warnings to provide immediate visual feedback during test execution. Implements test result aggregation through tuple-based storage with pass/fail statistics calculation and summary reporting. Employs `sys.path.insert(0)` for local module import resolution from parent directory structure. Maintains consistent async function signatures across all test functions for uniform execution patterns. Uses formatted string output with separator lines and hierarchical indentation for clear test section delineation and progress tracking.
