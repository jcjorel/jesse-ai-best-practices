#### Functional Intent & Features

This test script validates the `StrandsClaude4Driver` integration within the JESSE Framework MCP Server, specifically designed to verify AWS Bedrock Claude 4 Sonnet model functionality through the Strands Agent SDK. The script provides comprehensive testing capabilities for LLM driver configuration, conversation management, caching systems, and AWS integration validation. Key semantic entities include `StrandsClaude4Driver`, `Claude4SonnetConfig`, `ConversationMemoryStrategy`, `PromptCache`, `strands-agents` package integration, `AWS_REGION` and `AWS_PROFILE` environment variables, and `asyncio` async execution patterns. The testing framework implements structured validation through context manager patterns and provides detailed logging with emoji-based status indicators for driver initialization, conversation lifecycle management, and AWS credential validation.

##### Main Components

The script contains five primary async test functions: `test_basic_configuration()` for configuration validation and optimization presets, `test_driver_initialization()` for context manager lifecycle testing, `test_conversation_management()` for conversation state and statistics validation, `test_mock_responses()` for driver structure verification without API calls, and `test_caching_system()` for independent cache functionality testing. The `run_all_tests()` function orchestrates sequential test execution with result aggregation, while `main()` provides entry point functionality with environment validation and AWS credential checking.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture follows a comprehensive testing pattern with isolated test functions for each driver component, utilizing async context managers for proper resource cleanup. The design implements graceful degradation for missing AWS credentials, treating them as warnings rather than failures for structural validation. Error handling is structured with try-catch blocks around each test function, providing detailed logging and result tracking. The testing framework uses assertion-based validation combined with mock response testing to verify driver functionality without requiring actual AWS Bedrock API access.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses configuration factory methods (`create_optimized_for_conversations()`, `create_optimized_for_analysis()`, `create_optimized_for_performance()`) to test different optimization presets. Driver testing employs async context manager patterns with `async with StrandsClaude4Driver(config)` for proper initialization and cleanup. Caching system validation uses direct `PromptCache` instantiation with TTL expiration testing and LRU eviction verification. The testing strategy implements both positive path validation and error condition testing through invalid configuration attempts and missing dependency handling.

- **Ecosystem Position**: Critical testing component for LLM driver functionality within the MCP server architecture, validating conversation management and caching systems
- **Integration Pattern**: Executed by developers and CI/CD systems to verify AWS Bedrock connectivity and driver configuration before production deployment

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

Error handling covers missing `strands-agents` package installation with graceful exit and installation instructions, invalid configuration parameters with validation error capture, and missing AWS credentials with warning-level reporting. The script handles driver initialization failures through try-catch blocks with detailed error logging and continues with structural validation. Edge cases include AWS credential misconfiguration, Bedrock API access restrictions, cache TTL expiration timing, and conversation memory strategy validation. The testing framework provides differentiated error reporting through structured logging with emoji indicators and maintains test execution continuity despite individual test failures.

########## Internal Implementation Details

Configuration testing uses factory method validation with parameter inspection and invalid value rejection testing. Driver initialization employs context manager lifecycle verification with `is_initialized` property checking and conversation creation validation. Cache testing implements direct `PromptCache` manipulation with TTL timing validation using `asyncio.sleep()` and LRU eviction verification through entry count assertions. The test orchestration uses tuple-based test definition with function references and result aggregation through boolean return values.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Basic driver configuration and testing setup:**

This example demonstrates how to create optimized configurations and test driver initialization with proper error handling. The configuration factory methods provide preset optimizations for different use cases.

```python
# Create optimized configurations for different scenarios
config = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_performance()
async with StrandsClaude4Driver(config) as driver:
    conversation_id = "test_conversation_001"
    context = await driver.start_conversation(conversation_id)
    logger.info(f"Started conversation: {context.conversation_id}")
```

**Comprehensive test execution with result aggregation:**

This snippet shows how to run all validation tests with structured result reporting and error handling. The test runner provides detailed logging and summary reporting for CI/CD integration.

```python
# Execute all driver validation tests with result tracking
success = asyncio.run(run_all_tests())
if success:
    logger.info("üéâ All tests passed! The Strands Claude 4 driver is ready for use.")
else:
    logger.warning("‚ö†Ô∏è Some tests failed. Please check the implementation.")
```

**Cache system validation with TTL and eviction testing:**

This example demonstrates independent cache testing with expiration and eviction validation. The cache system supports TTL-based expiration and LRU eviction for memory management.

```python
# Test cache operations with TTL expiration and LRU eviction
cache = PromptCache(max_entries=3, ttl_seconds=1)
await cache.set("test prompt", "test_conversation", "config_hash", "test response")
cached_response = await cache.get("test prompt", "test_conversation", "config_hash")
assert cached_response == "test response", "Cache retrieval failed"
```
