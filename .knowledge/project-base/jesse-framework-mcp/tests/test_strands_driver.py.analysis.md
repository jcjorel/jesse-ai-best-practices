#### Functional Intent & Features

This test script validates the `StrandsClaude4Driver` functionality for AWS Bedrock Claude 4 Sonnet integration within the JESSE Framework MCP Server ecosystem. The script provides comprehensive testing of LLM driver initialization, conversation management, caching systems, and configuration validation for production readiness verification. Key semantic entities include `StrandsClaude4Driver`, `Claude4SonnetConfig`, `ConversationMemoryStrategy`, `StrandsDriverError`, `PromptCache`, `test_basic_configuration()`, `test_driver_initialization()`, `test_conversation_management()`, `test_mock_responses()`, `test_caching_system()`, `asyncio` async execution, `logging` framework, and `strands-agents` external package dependency. The testing framework enables developers to verify AWS Bedrock integration, conversation state management, prompt caching efficiency, and driver lifecycle management without requiring live API calls during development.

##### Main Components

The script contains five primary async test functions: `test_basic_configuration()` for validating configuration creation and optimization presets, `test_driver_initialization()` for testing driver lifecycle and context manager usage, `test_conversation_management()` for conversation state and statistics validation, `test_mock_responses()` for driver structure validation without API calls, and `test_caching_system()` for independent cache operations testing. The `run_all_tests()` function orchestrates sequential test execution with comprehensive result reporting, while `main()` provides entry point validation for dependencies and AWS credentials. Each test function implements detailed logging with emoji-based status indicators and structured error handling for debugging purposes.

###### Architecture & Design

The test architecture follows an isolation-first testing pattern where individual components are validated independently before integration testing. The design implements comprehensive configuration testing using factory methods (`create_optimized_for_conversations()`, `create_optimized_for_analysis()`, `create_optimized_for_performance()`) for different use case scenarios. The script uses async context manager patterns for proper resource cleanup and lifecycle management. Error handling is implemented at multiple levels with specific exception catching for `StrandsDriverError` and general exception handling for unexpected failures. The testing framework provides detailed logging with structured output formatting for debugging and CI/CD integration.

####### Implementation Approach

The testing strategy employs async/await patterns throughout with `asyncio.run()` orchestration for proper async context management. Configuration validation uses boundary testing with invalid parameters to verify constraint enforcement. Driver testing implements context manager usage patterns to ensure proper initialization and cleanup sequences. Conversation management testing uses small token limits (`max_context_tokens=1000`) and summary thresholds for controlled testing environments. Cache testing employs TTL-based expiration validation and LRU eviction testing with controlled entry limits. The implementation includes comprehensive statistics collection and validation for both conversation-level and global metrics.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**‚Üí Inbound:**
- `jesse_framework_mcp.llm.strands_agent_driver:StrandsClaude4Driver` - primary LLM driver class

**‚Üê Outbound:**
- Test execution reports consumed by developers and CI/CD pipelines
- Console output with structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- Exit codes for automated testing pipeline integration

**‚ö° System role and ecosystem integration:**
- **System Role**: Critical validation component ensuring Strands Claude 4 driver integration functions correctly within JESSE Framework MCP Server
- **Ecosystem Position**: Core testing infrastructure for LLM driver validation and AWS Bedrock integration verification
- **Integration Pattern**: Executed by developers during development, CI/CD pipelines for automated validation, and deployment verification processes for production readiness

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The script handles multiple edge cases including missing `strands-agents` package installation (with specific pip install guidance), invalid configuration parameters (temperature bounds validation), missing AWS credentials (with environment variable setup instructions), and driver initialization failures in environments without proper AWS Bedrock access. Exception handling includes comprehensive error categorization with specific handling for `ImportError`, `StrandsDriverError`, and general exceptions. The testing framework provides graceful degradation for AWS credential issues, treating them as warnings rather than failures for structural validation. Individual test isolation ensures that failures in one test component do not prevent execution of subsequent tests.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The test functions implement emoji-based status reporting using Unicode characters (`‚úÖ`, `‚ùå`, `‚ö†Ô∏è`, `üöÄ`, `üéâ`, `üõë`) for immediate visual feedback on test results. Configuration testing includes boundary validation with temperature limits and parameter constraint verification. Driver lifecycle testing validates `is_initialized` state management and proper cleanup sequences. Cache testing implements controlled TTL expiration with `asyncio.sleep(1.1)` delays and LRU eviction validation with entry count verification. The script uses structured logging with timestamp formatting and hierarchical logger naming for debugging and monitoring integration.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Basic driver configuration and initialization pattern:**

This code demonstrates the standard pattern for configuring and initializing the Strands Claude 4 driver with proper resource management. It ensures proper cleanup and provides foundation for conversation management.

```python
# Configure and initialize Strands Claude 4 driver with context manager
config = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_performance()
async with StrandsClaude4Driver(config) as driver:
    conversation_id = "test_conversation_001"
    context = await driver.start_conversation(conversation_id)
    logger.info(f"Started conversation: {context.conversation_id}")
```

**Configuration optimization for different use cases:**

This pattern shows how to create optimized configurations for specific scenarios. It provides pre-configured settings for conversations, analysis, and performance-critical applications.

```python
# Create optimized configurations for different use cases
conversation_config = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_conversations()
analysis_config = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_analysis()
performance_config = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_performance()

logger.info(f"Conversation config - Memory strategy: {conversation_config.memory_strategy}")
logger.info(f"Analysis config - Temperature: {analysis_config.temperature}")
```

**Cache system validation and statistics monitoring:**

This approach demonstrates cache operations testing with TTL validation and eviction behavior verification. It provides foundation for monitoring cache performance and ensuring proper memory management.

```python
# Test cache operations with TTL and eviction validation
from jesse_framework_mcp.llm.strands_agent_driver.conversation import PromptCache
cache = PromptCache(max_entries=3, ttl_seconds=1)
await cache.set("test prompt", "config_hash", "test response")
cached_response = await cache.get("test prompt", "config_hash")
stats = cache.stats()
logger.info(f"Cache stats: {stats}")
```
