#### Functional Intent & Features

This test suite validates the `StrandsClaude4Driver` implementation for AWS Bedrock Claude 4 Sonnet integration within the Jesse Framework MCP ecosystem. It provides comprehensive testing capabilities for configuration validation, driver lifecycle management, conversation handling, caching mechanisms, and error scenarios. The suite enables developers to verify driver functionality independently from the main MCP server, supporting both structural validation and integration testing. Key semantic entities include `StrandsClaude4Driver`, `Claude4SonnetConfig`, `ConversationMemoryStrategy`, `PromptCache`, `StrandsDriverError`, `asyncio`, `logging`, AWS Bedrock integration, and conversation management patterns. The implementation leverages async/await patterns for non-blocking test execution and context manager protocols for proper resource cleanup.

##### Main Components

The test suite contains five primary test functions: `test_basic_configuration()` validates configuration creation and parameter validation, `test_driver_initialization()` verifies driver lifecycle and context manager usage, `test_conversation_management()` tests conversation operations without API calls, `test_mock_responses()` validates driver structure and error handling, and `test_caching_system()` independently tests the `PromptCache` implementation. Supporting components include `run_all_tests()` for orchestrating test execution and result reporting, `main()` for environment validation and entry point coordination, and comprehensive logging setup with structured output formatting.

###### Architecture & Design

The test architecture follows an async-first design pattern with each test function operating independently while sharing common configuration and logging infrastructure. The suite implements a layered testing approach: structural validation tests verify component initialization and configuration without external dependencies, integration tests validate AWS Bedrock connectivity when credentials are available, and isolated unit tests verify individual components like caching. Error handling uses try-catch blocks with graceful degradation, allowing tests to continue even when external dependencies are unavailable. The design separates concerns between driver functionality testing and infrastructure validation.

####### Implementation Approach

Test execution uses `asyncio.run()` for async coordination with individual test functions returning boolean success indicators. Configuration testing employs factory methods like `create_optimized_for_conversations()`, `create_optimized_for_analysis()`, and `create_optimized_for_performance()` to validate different optimization strategies. Driver testing utilizes async context managers (`async with StrandsClaude4Driver(config)`) to ensure proper resource cleanup. The caching system tests implement time-based validation with `asyncio.sleep()` for TTL verification and sequential operations for eviction testing. Error scenarios are tested through invalid parameter injection and exception capture patterns.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**→ Inbound:**
- `jesse_framework_mcp.llm.strands_agent_driver` - core driver classes and configuration
- `strands` (external library) - Strands Agent SDK for AWS Bedrock integration
- `asyncio` (stdlib) - async execution and sleep operations
- `logging` (stdlib) - structured test output and debugging
- `pathlib.Path` (stdlib) - project root path resolution
- `os` (stdlib) - environment variable access for AWS configuration

**← Outbound:**
- Test execution reports consumed by CI/CD systems
- Validation results for Jesse Framework MCP server integration
- AWS credential validation for deployment environments
- Driver functionality verification for dependent components

**⚡ System role and ecosystem integration:**
- **System Role**: Critical validation component ensuring Strands Claude 4 driver reliability before MCP server deployment
- **Ecosystem Position**: Development and testing infrastructure component supporting the Jesse Framework MCP server's LLM integration capabilities
- **Integration Pattern**: Executed by developers during development, CI/CD pipelines for automated validation, and deployment processes for environment verification

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The suite handles missing `strands-agents` package installation with graceful ImportError catching and installation guidance. AWS credential absence is managed through environment variable detection with warning messages rather than test failures. Invalid configuration parameters trigger validation error testing to ensure proper boundary checking. Driver initialization failures are caught and logged as warnings when external dependencies are unavailable, allowing structural tests to continue. The caching system handles TTL expiration, maximum entry limits, and concurrent access scenarios. Test interruption via KeyboardInterrupt is managed with cleanup messaging and proper exit codes.

########## Internal Implementation Details

Logging configuration uses `basicConfig` with timestamp, logger name, level, and message formatting for comprehensive test traceability. Path manipulation adds the project root to `sys.path` using `Path(__file__).parent.parent` for reliable import resolution. Test result tracking uses tuple lists with test names and boolean outcomes for summary generation. The caching test creates a `PromptCache` instance with `max_entries=3` and `ttl_seconds=1` for rapid validation cycles. Configuration validation tests inject invalid parameters like `temperature=1.5` to trigger validation exceptions. AWS environment detection checks both `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_PROFILE` environment variables for credential availability assessment.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Basic test execution pattern:**
```python
# Run the complete test suite
python test_strands_driver.py
```

**Configuration testing demonstrates factory method usage:**
```python
# Create optimized configurations for different use cases
conversation_config = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_conversations()
analysis_config = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_analysis()
performance_config = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_performance()
```

**Driver lifecycle testing with proper resource management:**
```python
# Test driver initialization and cleanup
async with StrandsClaude4Driver(config) as driver:
    conversation_id = "test_conversation_001"
    context = await driver.start_conversation(conversation_id)
    stats = await driver.get_conversation_stats(conversation_id)
```

**Independent cache validation for TTL and eviction behavior:**
```python
# Test caching system independently
cache = PromptCache(max_entries=3, ttl_seconds=1)
await cache.set("test prompt", "test_conversation", "config_hash", "test response")
cached_response = await cache.get("test prompt", "test_conversation", "config_hash")
```
