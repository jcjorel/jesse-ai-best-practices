#### Functional Intent & Features

This focused test script validates the knowledge base filename generation fix within the JESSE Framework MCP Server hierarchical indexing system, specifically designed to verify that root directories generate `root_kb.md` files instead of `{directory_name}_kb.md` files. The test provides comprehensive validation capabilities for root directory detection, knowledge file path generation, and handler root identification logic. Key semantic entities include `KnowledgeBuilder`, `IndexingConfig`, `DirectoryContext`, `FileContext`, `ProcessingStatus`, `MockContext`, `test_root_kb_filename_generation`, `_get_knowledge_file_path`, `_is_handler_root_directory`, `asyncio` async execution, `tempfile` temporary directory management, and `project-base` handler type configuration. The testing framework implements four-phase validation through project root testing, subdirectory testing, git clone `.kb` directory testing, and root detection logic verification with detailed console output and assertion-based validation.

##### Main Components

The test script contains two primary components: `MockContext` class providing simplified logging functionality without LLM integration, and `test_root_kb_filename_generation()` async function implementing comprehensive filename generation validation. The main execution function `main()` orchestrates test execution with error handling and result reporting. The test function implements four distinct test phases: project root directory validation, regular subdirectory validation, git clone `.kb` directory validation, and root detection logic verification with detailed console output and boolean success tracking.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture follows a focused testing pattern with isolated validation of specific knowledge base filename generation functionality, utilizing temporary directory structures for realistic testing scenarios. The design implements comprehensive root directory detection testing through multiple directory type scenarios including project roots, subdirectories, and git clone `.kb` directories. Error handling is structured with try-catch blocks and detailed console logging for debugging. The testing framework uses realistic directory structures combined with `KnowledgeBuilder` integration to validate end-to-end filename generation behavior.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses temporary directory creation with `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` for isolated testing environments and realistic file system operations. Knowledge builder testing employs direct method calls to `_get_knowledge_file_path()` and `_is_handler_root_directory()` for targeted validation. Configuration setup uses dictionary-based `IndexingConfig.from_dict()` construction with minimal required parameters for testing focus. The testing strategy implements both positive and negative validation through different directory types and root detection scenarios with detailed path comparison and boolean assertion validation.

- **Integration Pattern**: Executed by developers and CI/CD systems to verify knowledge base filename generation behavior after bug fixes, ensuring consistent root_kb.md generation for handler root directories

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

Error handling covers temporary directory creation failures with automatic cleanup, knowledge builder initialization errors with detailed error reporting, and path generation validation failures with specific assertion messages. The test handles different directory type scenarios including project roots, subdirectories, and git clone `.kb` directories through conditional validation logic. Edge cases include missing source root parameters, invalid configuration dictionaries, and filesystem permission issues during temporary directory operations. The testing framework provides comprehensive error scenario coverage through exception handling and detailed console output for debugging failed assertions.

########## Internal Implementation Details

Root directory detection uses `_is_handler_root_directory()` method calls with different parameter combinations for project roots versus git clone directories. Knowledge file path generation employs `_get_knowledge_file_path()` with source root and directory path parameters for different scenarios. Configuration creation uses minimal dictionary structures with required fields including `handler_type`, `file_processing`, `content_filtering`, `llm_config`, `change_detection`, `error_handling`, `output_config`, and `debug_config` sections. Test validation uses direct path comparison with expected path construction and boolean assertion logic for success tracking.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Basic root directory filename generation testing:**

This example demonstrates how to test knowledge base filename generation for root directories. The test validates that project root directories generate `root_kb.md` files instead of directory-specific names.

```python
# Test project root directory filename generation
config = IndexingConfig.from_dict(config_dict)
knowledge_builder = KnowledgeBuilder(config)
root_kb_path = knowledge_builder._get_knowledge_file_path(project_root, project_root)
expected_root_path = knowledge_dir / "project-base" / "root_kb.md"
assert root_kb_path == expected_root_path
```

**Root detection logic validation with different directory types:**

This snippet shows how to test root directory detection logic for different scenarios. The test verifies that root detection works correctly for project roots, subdirectories, and git clone `.kb` directories.

```python
# Test root detection logic for different directory types
is_project_root = knowledge_builder._is_handler_root_directory(project_root, project_root)
is_subdir_root = knowledge_builder._is_handler_root_directory(subdir, project_root)
is_kb_root = knowledge_builder._is_handler_root_directory(git_clone_kb_dir, None)
assert is_project_root and not is_subdir_root and is_kb_root
```

**Comprehensive test configuration with minimal required fields:**

This example demonstrates how to create minimal test configuration for knowledge builder testing. The configuration includes all required sections with minimal values for focused testing scenarios.

```python
# Create minimal configuration for knowledge builder testing
config_dict = {
    "handler_type": "project-base",
    "file_processing": {"max_file_size": 1024, "batch_size": 1},
    "content_filtering": {"excluded_extensions": [], "excluded_directories": []},
    "llm_config": {"llm_model": "claude-4-sonnet", "temperature": 0.3},
    "output_config": {"knowledge_output_directory": str(knowledge_dir)}
}
config = IndexingConfig.from_dict(config_dict)
```
