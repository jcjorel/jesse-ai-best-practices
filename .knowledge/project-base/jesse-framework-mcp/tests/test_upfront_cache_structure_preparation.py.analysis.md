#### Functional Intent & Features

Validates upfront cache structure preparation functionality within the JESSE Framework MCP Server knowledge building system through comprehensive testing of directory pre-creation, race condition elimination, and hierarchical indexer integration. Provides automated verification of the `prepare_cache_structure()` method implementation, concurrent operation safety, and fallback behavior when structure preparation fails. Enables developers to verify that cache directory structures are properly created before file operations to prevent race conditions and improve performance in multi-threaded environments. Key semantic entities include `FileAnalysisCache` with `prepare_cache_structure()` method, `HierarchicalIndexer` integration, `IndexingConfig` configuration management, `DirectoryContext` and `FileContext` from knowledge context models, `MockContext` test helper, `MockKnowledgeBuilder` for LLM simulation, `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` for isolated testing, `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent operation testing, and `_collect_all_files_recursive()` internal method for directory traversal.

##### Main Components

Contains three primary test functions: `test_cache_structure_preparation()` for validating basic cache directory pre-creation functionality, `test_hierarchical_indexer_integration()` for testing integration with the hierarchical indexing system including concurrent operation safety, and `test_fallback_behavior()` for verifying on-demand directory creation when upfront preparation fails. Includes `MockContext` class providing async logging methods with message tracking, `MockKnowledgeBuilder` class simulating LLM operations without external API calls, and `create_directory_context()` helper function for building recursive directory structures from file lists. The `run_all_tests()` orchestration function executes sequential test execution with comprehensive result reporting and performance metrics.

###### Architecture & Design

Implements comprehensive test architecture with isolated temporary directories and complex nested project structures to simulate realistic development scenarios. Uses mock object pattern for external dependencies like LLM builders and MCP contexts, enabling testing without actual API calls or server connections. Employs concurrent operation testing through `asyncio.gather()` to validate race condition prevention and thread safety. Separates upfront preparation testing from fallback behavior testing to enable precise identification of preparation-specific vs on-demand creation issues. Follows defensive testing principles with explicit validation of directory existence, file operations, and error condition handling.

####### Implementation Approach

Testing strategy uses `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` for isolated file system operations and complex nested directory creation with multiple files per directory level. Cache structure validation employs direct file system inspection of expected cache directory paths and verification of directory existence before and after preparation. Concurrent operation testing creates multiple simultaneous cache operations using `asyncio.gather()` to validate thread safety and race condition prevention. Mock LLM integration uses predetermined response patterns to simulate knowledge building without external dependencies. Error detection analyzes context messages for race condition indicators and file system operation failures.

######## Code Usage Examples

Execute comprehensive upfront cache structure preparation testing. This validates all aspects of cache directory pre-creation and concurrent operation safety:

```python
# Run all upfront cache structure preparation tests
success = asyncio.run(run_all_tests())
sys.exit(0 if success else 1)
```

Test basic cache structure preparation with directory verification. This demonstrates upfront directory creation and validates proper cache structure establishment:

```python
# Test upfront cache structure preparation
cache = FileAnalysisCache(config)
root_context = await create_directory_context(source_root, files_created)
await cache.prepare_cache_structure(root_context, source_root, ctx)
assert cache_root.exists(), "Cache root should exist after preparation"
```

Validate concurrent cache operations safety with race condition prevention. This tests multiple simultaneous cache operations to ensure thread safety:

```python
# Test concurrent cache operations safety
async def concurrent_cache_operation(file_path, analysis_content):
    await cache.cache_analysis(file_path, analysis_content, source_root)

tasks = [concurrent_cache_operation(file, f"Analysis {i}") for i, file in enumerate(files)]
await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

########## Edge Cases & Error Handling

Handles missing cache directories gracefully through upfront preparation and validates proper directory creation before file operations. Manages concurrent operation scenarios through systematic testing of multiple simultaneous cache operations and race condition detection. Addresses fallback behavior when upfront preparation fails by testing on-demand directory creation capabilities. Provides comprehensive error reporting through message analysis for race condition indicators like "FileExistsError", "directory exists", and "concurrent access" patterns. Implements graceful degradation testing for file system operation failures and validates proper error propagation through the cache hierarchy.

########### Internal Implementation Details

Uses emoji-based visual feedback system (‚úÖ, ‚ùå, üí•) for immediate test status recognition with detailed progress logging and message tracking through `MockContext`. Implements complex nested directory structure creation with multiple files per directory level to simulate realistic project scenarios. Employs systematic concurrent operation testing through `asyncio.gather()` with task coordination and result validation. Test result aggregation uses tuple lists for test name and boolean result pairs with percentage-based success rate calculation. Mock LLM builder provides deterministic responses for knowledge building simulation while preserving actual cache integration logic paths. Directory context creation uses recursive traversal with relative path calculation and subdirectory processing for comprehensive structure validation.
