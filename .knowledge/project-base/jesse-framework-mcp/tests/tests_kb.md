## Global Summary

#### Functional Intent & Features

This directory provides comprehensive test coverage for the JESSE Framework MCP Server's core functionality, validating knowledge base indexing, resource management, caching systems, and project configuration through automated testing suites. The test infrastructure enables developers to verify system reliability, performance characteristics, and integration correctness before deployment by testing critical components including `HierarchicalIndexer` processing, `FileAnalysisCache` optimization, MCP resource endpoints, and project root detection mechanisms. Key semantic entities include `pytest` testing framework, `asyncio` async execution patterns, `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` for isolated testing, `MockContext` simulation classes, `IndexingConfig` configuration management, `ProcessingStatus` result validation, `get_project_root()` path utilities, `unwrap_fastmcp_function()` decorator handling, `StrandsClaude4Driver` LLM integration, `format_http_section()` HTTP formatting, `ContentCriticality` validation, and comprehensive test orchestration functions across multiple testing scenarios.

##### Main Components

Contains twelve primary test files covering distinct functional areas: session initialization resource testing (`test_session_init_resource.py`), knowledge resource validation (`test_new_resources.py`), LLM driver integration (`test_strands_driver.py`), configuration defaults (`test_default_knowledge_directory.py`), cache functionality (`test_file_analysis_cache_integration.py`, `test_upfront_cache_structure_preparation.py`), compliance debugging (`test_comprehensive_change_detection.py`, `test_smart_compliance_debug.py`), HTTP formatting (`test_http_formatting.py`), project detection (`test_project_root.py`), business rule validation (`test_project_base_indexing_rule.py`), resource endpoints (`test_gitignore_resource.py`), and integration testing (`test_project_indexing_integration.py`). Supporting utilities include `MockContext` classes for async logging simulation, `MockKnowledgeBuilder` for LLM response mocking, and comprehensive test orchestration functions with result aggregation and performance metrics reporting.

###### Architecture & Design

Implements comprehensive testing architecture with isolated test environments using temporary directories and mock object patterns to eliminate external dependencies during testing. Uses sequential test execution patterns with individual result tracking and comprehensive status reporting through emoji-based visual indicators. Employs separation of concerns between unit testing of individual components and integration testing with real project structures. Follows defensive testing principles with explicit validation of error conditions, edge cases, and boundary value analysis. Implements async-first testing patterns with proper resource cleanup through context managers and exception handling for robust test isolation.

####### Implementation Approach

Testing strategy employs `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` for filesystem isolation, `asyncio.run()` for async test coordination, and direct function invocation with comprehensive parameter validation. Uses mock object patterns through custom `MockContext` classes that simulate MCP server interfaces without requiring full server initialization.

success = asyncio.run(run_all_cache_tests())

# Validate HTTP formatting with specific parameters
from jesse_framework_mcp.helpers.http_formatter import format_http_section
result = format_http_section(
    content="Test content",
    content_type="text/markdown",
    criticality="CRITICAL"
)
```

Execute integration testing against real project structures. This validates system behavior under authentic complexity conditions:

```python
# Run real project integration testing
from tests.test_project_indexing_integration import main
success = asyncio.run(main())

# Test project root detection with environment validation
from tests.test_project_root import test_project_root_detection
await test_project_root_detection()
```

### {PROJECT_ROOT}/jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_session_init_resource.py file

*Last Updated: 2025-07-03T22:29:32Z*

#### Functional Intent & Features

Validates default knowledge directory configuration behavior within the JESSE Framework MCP Server by testing the `IndexingConfig` class automatic path resolution to `{PROJECT_ROOT}/.knowledge/` directory. Provides automated verification of configuration defaults, explicit path overrides, and serialization functionality to ensure knowledge base files are stored in the correct location. Enables developers to verify that knowledge indexing operations use the proper default directory structure without requiring manual configuration. Key semantic entities include `IndexingConfig` class, `knowledge_output_directory` attribute, `get_project_root()` function, `test_default_knowledge_directory()` function, `test_project_root_integration()` function, `to_dict()` method, `pathlib.Path` for path operations, `sys.path.insert()` for module imports, and `.knowledge/` directory convention.

##### Main Components

Contains two primary test functions: `test_default_knowledge_directory()` for comprehensive validation of default path behavior, explicit override functionality, and serialization correctness, and `test_project_root_integration()` for verifying project root detection mechanisms. The main execution block orchestrates sequential test execution with success tracking and exit code management. Test validation covers three scenarios: default behavior verification, explicit specification override testing, and configuration serialization validation.

###### Architecture & Design

Implements sequential test execution pattern with boolean return values for success tracking and comprehensive status reporting. Uses direct class instantiation testing rather than mock objects to validate actual configuration behavior. Employs defensive programming with fallback behavior validation when project root detection fails. Separates project root detection testing from configuration testing to isolate potential failure points and provide specific error context.

####### Implementation Approach

Testing strategy uses direct `IndexingConfig` instantiation with and without parameters to validate default behavior and override functionality. Path comparison employs `pathlib.Path` objects for cross-platform compatibility and exact matching. Serialization testing uses the `to_dict()` method to verify configuration persistence and string representation accuracy. Project root detection validation calls `get_project_root()` directly to test the underlying path resolution mechanism. Error handling provides graceful degradation with warning messages for missing project root scenarios.

######## Code Usage Examples

Test default knowledge directory configuration behavior. This validates that `IndexingConfig` automatically sets the knowledge output directory to the project root:

```python
# Validate default knowledge directory configuration
config = IndexingConfig()
expected_project_root = get_project_root()
expected_knowledge_dir = expected_project_root / '.knowledge'
assert config.knowledge_output_directory == expected_knowledge_dir
```

Test explicit knowledge directory override functionality. This ensures that manually specified paths take precedence over default behavior:

```python
# Test explicit path specification override
custom_path = Path("/tmp/custom_knowledge")
config2 = IndexingConfig(knowledge_output_directory=custom_path)
assert config2.knowledge_output_directory == custom_path
```

Validate configuration serialization and project root detection. This tests the persistence mechanism and underlying path resolution:

```python
# Test serialization and project root integration
config_dict = config.to_dict()
project_root = get_project_root()
expected_str = str(project_root / '.knowledge')
assert config_dict['knowledge_output_directory'] == expected_str
```

**‚ö° Integration:**

- Protocol: Direct Python imports and function calls

- Interface: Class instantiation, method invocation, and attribute access

- Coupling: Tight coupling with IndexingConfig class and loose coupling with path utilities

########## Edge Cases & Error Handling

Handles project root detection failure gracefully with warning messages and fallback behavior validation. Manages missing or None project root scenarios by verifying that `knowledge_output_directory` remains None when project root cannot be detected. Addresses serialization edge cases when project root is unavailable by skipping serialization tests with appropriate warning messages. Provides comprehensive test result reporting with specific failure context and emoji-based visual indicators for immediate status recognition.

########### Internal Implementation Details

Uses emoji-based status reporting (‚úÖ, ‚ùå, ‚ö†Ô∏è) for immediate visual feedback during test execution. Implements boolean success tracking with early return on test failures to prevent cascade errors. Path comparison uses exact equality checking between `pathlib.Path` objects for reliable cross-platform validation. Test orchestration employs sequential execution with individual test result aggregation and final success determination. Exit code management returns 0 for success and 1 for failures to enable proper CI/CD integration and automated testing workflows.

Uses direct file system access for validation rather than MCP resource calls, enabling testing of underlying file structure integrity. Employs exception handling at the function level with detailed error reporting and status indicators using emoji-based visual feedback system.

####### Implementation Approach

Utilizes `os.path.exists()` for file system validation combined with UTF-8 file reading for content inspection. Implements pattern matching through string containment checks for expected content markers. Uses `sys.path.insert(0)` for local module import resolution and async/await patterns for consistent execution flow. Applies defensive programming with try-catch blocks around each test operation and provides both positive and negative test result reporting.

######## Code Usage Examples

if os.path.exists(readme_path):
    with open(readme_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        content = f.read()
    if "Git Clone Knowledge Bases Index" in content:
        print("‚úÖ Git clones README contains expected header")
```

Error handling includes comprehensive exception catching in the main execution flow with traceback printing for debugging, keyboard interrupt handling for graceful test termination, and validation of empty or missing resource content from session initialization. The script addresses scenarios where `JESSE_PROJECT_ROOT` environment variable is unset, Git repositories are not found in the directory hierarchy, and FastMCP function unwrapping fails during resource testing.

########### Internal Implementation Details

The script uses `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent))` for dynamic package path resolution, enabling execution from various directory contexts without installation requirements. The `TestContext` class implements async logging methods that mirror the actual MCP server context interface, with conditional output suppression in dump mode to prevent interference with resource content extraction. Internal mechanics include string-based content analysis for detecting setup guidance versus actual session content, section counting using `result.count("Content-Type:")` for HTTP-style resource validation, and character count reporting for content size verification. The argument parser uses `RawDescriptionHelpFormatter` to preserve example formatting in help text, with boolean flag handling for execution mode switching.

```python
config = IndexingConfig(
    indexing_mode=IndexingMode.INCREMENTAL,
    enable_project_base_indexing=True,
    debug_mode=True,
    max_file_size=2 * 1024 * 1024,
    batch_size=5,
    max_concurrent_operations=2,
    continue_on_file_errors=True
)
indexer = HierarchicalIndexer(config)
result = await indexer.index_hierarchy(project_root, ctx)
```

```python
success_criteria = {
    "Indexing completed": result.overall_status == ProcessingStatus.COMPLETED,
    "Files discovered": stats.total_files_discovered > 0,
    "Some files processed": stats.files_processed > 0,
    "No critical failure": len(ctx.error_messages) < stats.total_files_discovered
}
files_success_rate = (stats.files_completed / max(stats.total_files_discovered, 1)) * 100
integration_success = all_criteria_met and files_success_rate > 50
```

*Last Updated: 2025-07-03T22:29:32Z*

#### Functional Intent & Features

This test script validates the `jesse://project/gitignore-files` MCP resource functionality, providing comprehensive testing of gitignore file discovery and HTTP-formatted response generation within the JESSE Framework MCP Server. The script enables developers to verify proper resource behavior, boundary marker formatting, and writable content flag functionality through automated testing workflows that examine `get_project_gitignore_files()` resource function, `unwrap_fastmcp_function()` utility, and `MockContext` simulation patterns. Key semantic entities include `asyncio` event loop management, `pathlib.Path` operations, `project_resources` module integration, `JESSE_FRAMEWORK_BOUNDARY_2025` HTTP boundaries, `Content-Writable: true` headers, `Content-Section: gitignore-file` markers, and directory-specific gitignore validation for Project Root, Coding Assistant Artifacts, Knowledge Management System, and Project-Specific Rules sections.

##### Main Components

The script contains two primary async test functions: `test_gitignore_resource()` which creates a `MockContext` class with `info()` and `error()` logging methods, unwraps the FastMCP decorated function, executes the gitignore resource, and validates response structure through boundary counting and section verification; and `main()` which handles test orchestration, working directory setup, and exit code management. Supporting components include the `MockContext` class providing async logging interface simulation with message collection capabilities, directory validation logic for specific gitignore categories, and comprehensive response verification mechanisms checking HTTP boundary markers, writable headers, and content sections.

###### Architecture & Design

The script follows a mock-based testing architecture with clear separation between resource function testing and response validation logic. The design implements a lightweight context simulation pattern using `MockContext` class that mirrors the actual MCP server context interface without requiring full server initialization. The architecture supports comprehensive response structure validation through systematic counting of HTTP boundaries, content headers, and section markers, with working directory management ensuring tests execute from the correct project root context for accurate gitignore file discovery.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses FastMCP function unwrapping through `unwrap_fastmcp_function()` utility to enable direct testing of decorated resource functions without MCP server overhead. The script employs systematic response validation using string counting methods for `JESSE_FRAMEWORK_BOUNDARY_2025` boundaries, `Content-Writable: true` headers, and `Content-Section` markers to verify proper HTTP formatting. Key technical strategies include working directory manipulation via `os.chdir()` for project root context, message collection through `MockContext.messages` list for debugging, and comprehensive section validation checking for specific directory categories within gitignore responses.

######## Code Usage Examples

Execute comprehensive gitignore resource testing with detailed validation output:

```python
# Run the complete gitignore resource test suite
python test_gitignore_resource.py

# Expected output includes boundary marker counting, writable header validation,
# and directory-specific section verification for all gitignore categories
```

Test individual resource function behavior programmatically:

```python
from utils import unwrap_fastmcp_function
from jesse_framework_mcp.resources import project_resources

# Unwrap and test the gitignore resource function directly
unwrapped_function = unwrap_fastmcp_function(project_resources.get_project_gitignore_files)
result = await unwrapped_function(mock_context)
```

Validate response structure components for debugging:

```python
# Check HTTP boundary formatting and content sections
boundary_count = result.count("--JESSE_FRAMEWORK_BOUNDARY_2025--")
writable_count = result.count("Content-Writable: true")
gitignore_sections = result.count("Content-Section: gitignore-file")
```
