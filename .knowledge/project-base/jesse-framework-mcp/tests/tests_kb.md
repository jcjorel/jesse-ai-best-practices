### {PROJECT_ROOT}/jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_comprehensive_change_detection.py

*Last Updated: 2025-07-05T14:14:39Z*

#### Functional Intent & Features

This test script validates comprehensive change detection enhancements for the JESSE Framework knowledge building system, specifically testing constituent dependency checking for directory knowledge files through multi-layered staleness detection. The script provides validation of cache-first processing, timestamp-based freshness checking, hierarchical dependency propagation, and performance optimization for knowledge base rebuilding decisions. Key semantic entities include `FileAnalysisCache`, `ChangeDetector`, `IndexingConfig`, `DirectoryContext`, `FileContext`, `ProcessingStatus`, `MockContext`, `test_file_analysis_cache_staleness_checking()`, `test_detailed_staleness_info()`, `test_change_detector_enhancements()`, `test_realistic_change_scenarios()`, `test_performance_optimization()`, `is_knowledge_file_stale()`, `get_constituent_staleness_info()`, `check_comprehensive_directory_change()`, `get_detailed_change_analysis()`, `get_knowledge_file_path()`, `timestamp_tolerance_seconds`, `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`, `asyncio` async execution, and `.knowledge/` directory structure. The testing framework enables developers to verify that knowledge base rebuilding occurs only when necessary, reducing computational overhead while maintaining content accuracy through intelligent dependency tracking.

##### Main Components

The script contains five primary async test functions: `test_file_analysis_cache_staleness_checking()` for validating comprehensive staleness detection methods, `test_detailed_staleness_info()` for testing detailed staleness information gathering, `test_change_detector_enhancements()` for enhanced ChangeDetector functionality validation, `test_realistic_change_scenarios()` for development workflow simulation, and `test_performance_optimization()` for performance benefit measurement. The `MockContext` class provides logging simulation with message tracking, while `create_directory_context()` helper function creates realistic DirectoryContext instances for testing. The `run_all_tests()` function orchestrates sequential test execution with comprehensive result reporting and performance metrics tracking.

###### Architecture & Design

The test architecture follows a multi-layered validation pattern where change detection is tested at multiple dependency levels: source files, cached analyses, subdirectory knowledge files, and hierarchical propagation. The design implements comprehensive scenario testing using realistic project structures with multiple directories, files, and dependency relationships. The script uses temporary directory isolation with `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` for clean test environments and controlled timestamp manipulation for precise staleness testing. Error handling is implemented through assertion-based validation with detailed diagnostic output for debugging change detection logic and dependency tracking issues.

####### Implementation Approach

The testing strategy employs controlled timestamp manipulation using `time.sleep()` delays and `timestamp_tolerance_seconds=0.05` for precise staleness detection testing. Change detection validation uses realistic file structure creation with JavaScript/TypeScript components, Python modules, and test files to simulate authentic development scenarios. Staleness checking implements multi-level dependency validation including source file timestamps, cached analysis freshness, and subdirectory knowledge file relationships. Performance testing creates moderate-sized project structures with multiple directories and files to measure change detection efficiency and optimization benefits.

- **Integration Pattern**: Executed by developers during development, CI/CD pipelines for automated change detection validation, and performance regression testing for knowledge building efficiency optimization

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The script handles multiple edge cases including missing knowledge files (treated as stale requiring rebuild), timestamp tolerance boundary conditions with `timestamp_tolerance_seconds=0.05`, concurrent file modifications during processing, hierarchical dependency chain validation failures, and performance degradation scenarios with large project structures. Exception handling includes comprehensive error catching with detailed diagnostic output for staleness detection failures, change propagation issues, and integration problems. The testing framework provides graceful handling of temporary directory cleanup failures and validates change detection behavior when multiple dependency layers are modified simultaneously. Individual test isolation ensures that failures in one change detection scenario do not prevent execution of subsequent validation tests.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The test functions implement emoji-based status reporting using Unicode characters (`‚úÖ`, `‚ùå`, `üéâ`, `üí•`, `üß™`, `üìä`) for immediate visual feedback on change detection behavior. Staleness validation includes direct file system verification of knowledge file creation, timestamp comparison with configurable tolerance, and multi-level dependency checking across source files, cached analyses, and subdirectory knowledge files. Mock context implementation tracks all logging messages for validation and provides structured output for debugging change detection logic. The script uses controlled timing with precise delays and realistic project structure simulation to test authentic development workflow scenarios.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Comprehensive staleness checking with multi-level dependencies:**

This code demonstrates the fundamental approach for testing FileAnalysisCache staleness detection with constituent dependencies. It validates that knowledge files are correctly identified as stale when cached analyses or subdirectory knowledge files are newer.

```python
# Test comprehensive staleness checking with constituent dependencies
config = IndexingConfig(timestamp_tolerance_seconds=0.05)
cache = FileAnalysisCache(config)

file_contexts = [FileContext(file_path=file1, file_size=file1.stat().st_size, 
                           last_modified=datetime.fromtimestamp(file1.stat().st_mtime))]

is_stale, reason = cache.is_knowledge_file_stale(
    source_root / "src", source_root, file_contexts
)
assert is_stale == True, "Should be stale when knowledge file missing"
```

**Enhanced change detection with hierarchical dependency propagation:**

This pattern tests ChangeDetector enhancements for comprehensive directory change checking with subdirectory dependencies. It validates that changes in subdirectory knowledge files correctly propagate to parent directory staleness detection.

```python
# Test enhanced change detection with hierarchical dependencies
detector = ChangeDetector(config)
directory_context = DirectoryContext(
    directory_path=source_root / "app",
    file_contexts=file_contexts
)

change_info = await detector.check_comprehensive_directory_change(
    directory_context, source_root, ctx
)
assert change_info.change_type.value == "new", "Should detect NEW change type"
```

**Realistic development scenario simulation with layered processing:**

This approach demonstrates testing realistic change scenarios that occur during development workflows. It validates that source file modifications do not directly trigger knowledge rebuilds, maintaining proper layered processing architecture.

```python
# Test realistic development scenario with layered processing validation
component_file.write_text("export default function Header() { return 'updated'; }")
components_context = create_directory_context(
    source_root / "src" / "components", [component_file], []
)

change_info = await detector.check_comprehensive_directory_change(
    components_context, source_root, ctx
)
assert change_info is None, "Source file changes should not directly trigger rebuilds"
```

### {PROJECT_ROOT}/jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_configuration_template_system.py

*Last Updated: 2025-07-05T14:14:39Z*

#### Functional Intent & Features

This test suite validates the configuration template system for the Jesse Framework MCP, providing comprehensive testing for centralized default configurations, JSON auto-generation, and Pydantic validation. The module ensures robust configuration management across different handler types (`project-base`, `git-clones`, `pdf-knowledge`) with proper validation and error handling. Key semantic entities include `IndexingConfigManager`, `IndexingConfigModel`, `HandlerType`, `PROJECT_BASE_DEFAULT_CONFIG`, `GIT_CLONES_DEFAULT_CONFIG`, `PDF_KNOWLEDGE_DEFAULT_CONFIG`, `get_default_config()`, `validate_handler_type()`, `get_supported_handler_types()`, and `IndexingConfig.load_for_handler()`. The testing framework leverages `pytest` fixtures, `tempfile` for isolated testing environments, and `unittest.mock.patch` for dependency isolation, ensuring configuration system reliability through hierarchical exclusion validation and cache management testing.

##### Main Components

The test suite contains six primary test classes: `TestDefaultConfigurations` validates centralized default configurations for all handler types, `TestPydanticValidation` ensures proper validation rules and error handling, `TestConfigurationManager` tests the `IndexingConfigManager` functionality including auto-generation and caching, `TestIndexingConfigIntegration` validates integration between configuration system and `IndexingConfig` model, `TestHierarchicalExclusions` verifies exclusion system behavior across handler types, and utility functions for testing supported handler types and validation logic.

###### Architecture & Design

The test architecture follows a hierarchical validation pattern with separate test classes for each major component, using pytest fixtures for test isolation and temporary directory management. The design implements comprehensive validation testing through Pydantic model validation, configuration manager testing with file system operations, and integration testing between multiple system components. Test organization separates concerns between default configuration validation, runtime validation, file system operations, and cross-component integration testing.

####### Implementation Approach

Tests utilize `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` for isolated file system testing, `pytest.raises()` for exception validation, and fixture-based setup for reusable test environments. The implementation strategy includes deep copy validation for configuration immutability, cache behavior testing through repeated operations, JSON file generation and parsing validation, and mock-based testing for external dependencies. Configuration validation tests cover chunk overlap validation, indexing mode validation, and handler-specific requirement validation.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

Error handling tests cover invalid handler type validation with specific error messages, malformed JSON configuration file handling, chunk overlap validation errors when overlap equals or exceeds chunk size, missing required exclusions for project-base handlers, and project root detection failures. The test suite validates proper error propagation through `pytest.raises()` assertions and ensures meaningful error messages for debugging. Cache clearing behavior is tested to prevent stale configuration issues, and file system permission scenarios are handled through temporary directory isolation.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The test implementation uses deep copy validation to ensure configuration template immutability, cache instance comparison to verify caching behavior, and JSON serialization/deserialization round-trip testing. Internal mechanisms include fixture cleanup through context managers, mock patching for external dependency isolation, and comprehensive assertion patterns for configuration validation. The test suite maintains separate validation paths for each handler type with specific exclusion requirements and validates proper Pydantic model conversion from dictionary data.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Basic configuration validation testing:**
```python
def test_get_default_config_project_base(self):
    config = get_default_config("project-base")
    assert config["handler_type"] == "project-base"
    assert config["max_file_size"] == 2 * 1024 * 1024
    assert ".knowledge" in config["project_base_exclusions"]
```

```python
@pytest.fixture
def temp_knowledge_dir(self):
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
        yield Path(temp_dir)

def test_auto_generate_missing_config(self, temp_knowledge_dir):
    manager = IndexingConfigManager(temp_knowledge_dir)
    config = manager.load_config("project-base")
    config_file = temp_knowledge_dir / "project-base.indexing-config.json"
    assert config_file.exists()
```

**Pydantic validation error testing:**
```python
def test_invalid_chunk_overlap(self):
    config_data = get_default_config("project-base")
    config_data["chunk_overlap"] = config_data["chunk_size"]
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
        IndexingConfigModel(**config_data)
    assert "chunk_overlap" in str(excinfo.value)
```

### {PROJECT_ROOT}/jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_default_knowledge_directory.py

*Last Updated: 2025-07-05T14:14:39Z*

#### Functional Intent & Features

This test script validates the default knowledge directory configuration behavior for the JESSE Framework knowledge base system, specifically testing that `IndexingConfig` automatically defaults to `{PROJECT_ROOT}/.knowledge/` when no explicit `knowledge_output_directory` is specified. The script provides comprehensive validation of configuration initialization, explicit override behavior, serialization correctness, and project root detection integration. Key semantic entities include `IndexingConfig` class, `get_project_root()` function, `test_default_knowledge_directory()`, `test_project_root_integration()`, `knowledge_output_directory` attribute, `to_dict()` method, `pathlib.Path` operations, and `.knowledge/` directory convention. The testing framework enables developers to verify that knowledge base files are automatically stored in the correct project-relative location without requiring explicit configuration, ensuring consistent knowledge management across different deployment environments.

##### Main Components

The script contains two primary test functions: `test_default_knowledge_directory()` for comprehensive configuration behavior validation with three sub-tests (default behavior, explicit specification, serialization), and `test_project_root_integration()` for project root detection verification. The main execution block orchestrates sequential test execution with success tracking and detailed console output formatting. Each test function implements structured validation with expected vs actual comparisons, emoji-based status indicators, and graceful handling of edge cases where project root detection fails.

###### Architecture & Design

The test architecture follows a multi-phase validation pattern where configuration behavior is tested through three distinct scenarios: default initialization, explicit override, and serialization round-trip. The design implements defensive testing with fallback behavior validation when project root detection fails, treating it as expected rather than failure. The script uses direct object instantiation and attribute comparison for validation rather than complex mocking frameworks. Error handling is implemented through boolean return values and structured console output with clear pass/fail indicators for each test phase.

####### Implementation Approach

The testing strategy employs direct configuration object instantiation with `IndexingConfig()` for default behavior testing and `IndexingConfig(knowledge_output_directory=custom_path)` for override validation. Path comparison uses `pathlib.Path` equality operations for cross-platform compatibility. Serialization testing uses the `to_dict()` method with string representation validation to ensure configuration persistence works correctly. The implementation includes comprehensive logging with expected vs actual value reporting and structured test phase separation for debugging purposes.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**‚Üí Inbound:**
- `jesse_framework_mcp.knowledge_bases.models.indexing_config:IndexingConfig` - primary configuration class under test
- `jesse_framework_mcp.helpers.path_utils:get_project_root` - project root detection utility
- `pathlib.Path` (stdlib) - cross-platform path operations
- `sys` (stdlib) - path manipulation and exit code management

**‚Üê Outbound:**
- Test execution reports consumed by developers for validation
- Console output with structured test results for debugging
- Exit codes for CI/CD pipeline integration and automated testing

**‚ö° System role and ecosystem integration:**
- **System Role**: Critical validation component ensuring knowledge base configuration defaults work correctly across different deployment environments
- **Ecosystem Position**: Core testing infrastructure for JESSE Framework knowledge management system configuration validation
- **Integration Pattern**: Executed by developers during development and CI/CD pipelines to verify that knowledge bases are stored in consistent, predictable locations without requiring explicit configuration

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The script handles multiple edge cases including project root detection failure (treated as expected behavior with appropriate fallback validation), missing or invalid configuration attributes, and serialization failures. Error handling includes graceful degradation when `get_project_root()` returns `None`, with specific validation that the configuration correctly handles this scenario. The testing framework provides detailed diagnostic output for each failure scenario, including expected vs actual value comparisons and specific error categorization. Individual test isolation ensures that failures in one validation phase do not prevent execution of subsequent tests.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The test functions implement emoji-based status reporting using Unicode characters (`‚úÖ`, `‚ùå`, `‚ö†Ô∏è`, `üéâ`, `üí•`) for immediate visual feedback on test results. Configuration validation includes direct attribute comparison with `pathlib.Path` objects and string representation verification for serialization testing. The script uses boolean return value aggregation for overall success tracking and structured console output with separator lines for visual test phase separation. Project root integration testing validates the underlying utility function independently to isolate configuration-specific issues from path detection problems.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Basic configuration default behavior validation:**

This code demonstrates the standard pattern for testing IndexingConfig default behavior. It validates that the configuration automatically sets the knowledge directory to the project root when not explicitly specified.

```python
# Test default knowledge directory configuration behavior
config = IndexingConfig()
expected_project_root = get_project_root()
if expected_project_root:
    expected_knowledge_dir = expected_project_root / '.knowledge'
    if config.knowledge_output_directory == expected_knowledge_dir:
        print("‚úÖ Default correctly set to PROJECT_ROOT/.knowledge/")
```

**Configuration override and serialization testing:**

This pattern validates that explicit configuration values override defaults and serialize correctly. It ensures that custom knowledge directories work properly while maintaining serialization compatibility.

```python
# Test explicit configuration override and serialization
custom_path = Path("/tmp/custom_knowledge")
config2 = IndexingConfig(knowledge_output_directory=custom_path)
config_dict = config2.to_dict()
knowledge_dir_str = config_dict.get('knowledge_output_directory')
if config2.knowledge_output_directory == custom_path:
    print("‚úÖ Explicit specification overrides default")
```

**Project root detection integration validation:**

This approach validates the underlying project root detection functionality independently. It ensures that the configuration system has reliable access to project structure information for default path resolution.

```python
# Validate project root detection for configuration defaults
project_root = get_project_root()
if project_root:
    print(f"‚úÖ Project root detected: {project_root}")
    print(f"Expected knowledge directory: {project_root / '.knowledge'}")
else:
    print("‚ùå Project root detection failed")
```

### {PROJECT_ROOT}/jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_file_analysis_cache_integration.py

*Last Updated: 2025-07-05T14:14:39Z*

#### Functional Intent & Features

This test script validates the `FileAnalysisCache` integration with the JESSE Framework knowledge building system, specifically testing cache-first processing, metadata stripping, freshness checking, and performance optimization for LLM-generated file analyses. The script provides comprehensive validation of cache storage/retrieval, timestamp-based staleness detection, KnowledgeBuilder integration, and performance benefits through cache hit simulation. Key semantic entities include `FileAnalysisCache`, `KnowledgeBuilder`, `IndexingConfig`, `FileContext`, `ProcessingStatus`, `MockContext`, `MockKnowledgeBuilder`, `test_cache_basic_functionality()`, `test_cache_freshness_checking()`, `test_cache_integration_with_knowledge_builder()`, `test_cache_performance_simulation()`, `METADATA_START`, `METADATA_END`, `get_cached_analysis()`, `cache_analysis()`, `get_cache_path()`, `get_cache_stats()`, `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`, `asyncio` async execution, and `.knowledge/` directory structure. The testing framework enables developers to verify that file analysis caching reduces LLM API calls, maintains content freshness, and integrates seamlessly with the knowledge building pipeline.

##### Main Components

The script contains four primary async test functions: `test_cache_basic_functionality()` for validating cache storage, retrieval, and metadata handling, `test_cache_freshness_checking()` for timestamp-based staleness detection, `test_cache_integration_with_knowledge_builder()` for end-to-end KnowledgeBuilder integration with mock LLM responses, and `test_cache_performance_simulation()` for multi-file cache hit rate validation. The `MockContext` class provides logging simulation for testing, while `MockKnowledgeBuilder` extends `KnowledgeBuilder` to simulate LLM responses without API calls. The `run_all_cache_tests()` function orchestrates sequential test execution with comprehensive result reporting and performance metrics.

###### Architecture & Design

The test architecture follows a comprehensive integration testing pattern where cache functionality is validated at multiple levels: basic operations, freshness logic, KnowledgeBuilder integration, and performance simulation. The design implements temporary directory isolation using `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` for clean test environments and realistic file structure simulation. The script uses mock inheritance patterns with `MockKnowledgeBuilder` extending the real `KnowledgeBuilder` to test actual integration points while avoiding external API dependencies. Error handling is implemented through boolean return values with detailed diagnostic output for debugging cache behavior and integration issues.

####### Implementation Approach

The testing strategy employs realistic file structure creation with TypeScript/React components for authentic cache testing scenarios. Cache validation uses direct file system verification of cache file creation at expected paths (`knowledge_dir / "project-base" / "components" / "Button.tsx.analysis.md"`). Freshness testing implements controlled timestamp manipulation using `asyncio.sleep(2)` delays and file modification to trigger staleness detection. Performance simulation creates multiple test files with mock analyses to validate cache hit rates and storage efficiency. The implementation includes comprehensive metadata validation using `METADATA_START` and `METADATA_END` delimiter checking.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The script handles multiple edge cases including cache file creation failures, timestamp tolerance edge cases with `timestamp_tolerance_seconds=1`, file modification during processing, missing cache directories, and metadata delimiter validation failures. Exception handling includes comprehensive error catching with detailed diagnostic output for cache misses, staleness detection failures, and integration issues. The testing framework provides graceful handling of temporary directory cleanup failures and validates cache behavior when source files are modified between cache operations. Individual test isolation ensures that failures in one cache scenario do not prevent execution of subsequent validation tests.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The test functions implement emoji-based status reporting using Unicode characters (`‚úÖ`, `‚ùå`, `üéâ`, `üí•`, `üß™`, `üìä`) for immediate visual feedback on cache behavior. Cache validation includes direct file system verification of cache file creation, metadata delimiter presence checking, and content comparison with whitespace tolerance for minor formatting differences. Mock LLM response simulation uses predefined analysis content to test cache storage without external API dependencies. The script uses controlled timestamp manipulation and file modification to trigger cache staleness detection with precise timing control through `asyncio.sleep()` delays.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Basic cache storage and retrieval validation pattern:**

This code demonstrates the fundamental cache operations testing approach with file creation and analysis storage. It validates that cache files are created in the correct directory structure and content is retrievable without metadata contamination.

```python
# Test basic cache functionality with temporary directory isolation
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
    temp_path = Path(temp_dir)
    knowledge_dir = temp_path / ".knowledge"
    source_root = temp_path / "project"
    test_file = source_root / "src" / "test.py"
    
    config = IndexingConfig(knowledge_output_directory=knowledge_dir)
    cache = FileAnalysisCache(config)
    
    test_analysis = "## Test Analysis\n\nThis is a test Python file analysis."
    await cache.cache_analysis(test_file, test_analysis, source_root)
    retrieved_analysis = await cache.get_cached_analysis(test_file, source_root)
```

**Cache freshness validation with timestamp manipulation:**

This pattern tests cache staleness detection by modifying files after caching and verifying that stale cache entries return None. It ensures that cache freshness checking works correctly with configurable timestamp tolerance.

```python
# Test cache freshness with controlled file modification timing
config = IndexingConfig(timestamp_tolerance_seconds=1)
cache = FileAnalysisCache(config)

await cache.cache_analysis(test_file, original_analysis, source_root)
await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Ensure timestamp difference
test_file.write_text("# Modified content")

stale_retrieval = await cache.get_cached_analysis(test_file, source_root)
if stale_retrieval is None:
    print("‚úÖ Modified file correctly invalidated cache")
```

**KnowledgeBuilder integration testing with mock LLM responses:**

This approach demonstrates end-to-end cache integration testing by extending KnowledgeBuilder with mock responses. It validates that cache hits and misses work correctly within the actual knowledge building pipeline without requiring external API calls.

```python
# Mock KnowledgeBuilder for integration testing without API calls
class MockKnowledgeBuilder(KnowledgeBuilder):
    async def _process_single_file(self, file_path: Path, content: str, ctx, source_root=None) -> str:
        cached_analysis = await self.analysis_cache.get_cached_analysis(file_path, source_root)
        if cached_analysis:
            await ctx.info(f"üìÑ CACHE HIT: Using cached analysis for {file_path.name}")
            return cached_analysis
        
        await ctx.info(f"ü§ñ CACHE MISS: Generating mock analysis for {file_path.name}")
        await self.analysis_cache.cache_analysis(file_path, mock_response, source_root)
        return mock_response
```

########### Code Usage Examples

Essential patterns for MCP resource testing and FastMCP function validation. These examples demonstrate comprehensive testing approaches for gitignore resource functionality and HTTP response validation.

```python
# Mock context implementation for isolated MCP resource testing
class MockContext:
    def __init__(self):
        self.messages = []
    
    async def info(self, message: str):
        self.messages.append(f"INFO: {message}")
        print(f"üìù {message}")
    
    async def error(self, message: str):
        self.messages.append(f"ERROR: {message}")
        print(f"‚ùå {message}")
```

FastMCP decorator unwrapping enables direct function testing without MCP protocol overhead. This approach allows comprehensive validation of resource function behavior and response formatting.

```python
# FastMCP function unwrapping for direct testing access
print("üîß Unwrapping FastMCP decorated function...")
unwrapped_function = unwrap_fastmcp_function(project_resources.get_project_gitignore_files)
print(f"‚úÖ Successfully unwrapped function: {unwrapped_function.__name__}")

result = await unwrapped_function(ctx)
```

HTTP response validation ensures proper boundary marker formatting and content section identification. This pattern validates MCP resource protocol compliance and content structure.

```python
# Comprehensive HTTP response validation for MCP resource testing
boundary_count = result.count("--JESSE_FRAMEWORK_BOUNDARY_2025--")
print(f"üìå Found {boundary_count} HTTP boundary markers")

writable_count = result.count("X-ASYNC-Content-Writable: true")
print(f"‚úèÔ∏è  Found {writable_count} writable content sections")

gitignore_sections = result.count("X-ASYNC-Content-Section: gitignore-file")
error_sections = result.count("X-ASYNC-Content-Section: gitignore-error")
print(f"üìÑ Found {gitignore_sections} gitignore file sections")
print(f"üö® Found {error_sections} error sections")
```

Working directory management ensures tests execute from proper project context for accurate resource validation. This approach handles path dependencies and file system access requirements.

```python
# Working directory configuration for proper test context
os.chdir(Path(__file__).parent.parent)
print(f"üìÇ Working directory: {os.getcwd()}")

success = await test_gitignore_resource()

if success:
    print("\nüéâ All tests passed!")
    exit(0)
else:
    print("\nüíî Tests failed!")
    exit(1)
```

### {PROJECT_ROOT}/jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_http_core_functionality.py

*Last Updated: 2025-07-05T14:14:39Z*

#### Functional Intent & Features

This file provides comprehensive test coverage for core HTTP functionality within the JESSE Framework MCP server, validating HTTP status code constants, error handling mechanisms, and content criticality classification. The file ensures proper HTTP response generation through testing of `XAsyncHttpStatus` class constants (200, 240, 241, 403, 404, 500), `XAsyncHttpErrorHandler` exception-to-status mapping, and `XAsyncContentCriticality` validation with case-insensitive normalization. Key semantic entities include `XAsyncHttpStatus` for status code management, `XAsyncHttpErrorHandler` for automatic error detection from Python exceptions, `XAsyncContentCriticality` for content priority validation, and `pytest` framework for comprehensive test execution. The testing architecture validates HTTP infrastructure reliability through status code verification, template-based error content generation, and robust input validation.

##### Main Components

The file contains three primary test classes: `TestHttpStatus` validates `XAsyncHttpStatus` class constants and `get_default_message()` method functionality, `TestHttpErrorHandler` tests `XAsyncHttpErrorHandler` error content generation and exception mapping capabilities, and `TestContentCriticality` validates `XAsyncContentCriticality` enum validation with case normalization. Each test class focuses on specific HTTP infrastructure components, providing comprehensive coverage of status code handling, error response generation, and content classification validation with both positive and negative test scenarios.

###### Architecture & Design

The test architecture follows pytest class-based organization with clear separation of HTTP functionality concerns. `TestHttpStatus` validates the foundation layer of HTTP status code constants and message mapping, while `TestHttpErrorHandler` tests the error handling layer that maps Python exceptions to appropriate HTTP responses. `TestContentCriticality` focuses on content classification validation with case-insensitive input handling. The design emphasizes defensive programming validation, template-based error content generation, and extensible HTTP status code support for future additions.

####### Implementation Approach

Tests utilize direct constant validation for `XAsyncHttpStatus` class attributes, ensuring each status code matches expected HTTP standard values. Error handling tests create actual Python exceptions (`FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, `ValueError`) to validate automatic exception-to-status mapping through `detect_error_from_exception()` method. Content criticality testing employs case variation strategies (uppercase, lowercase, mixed case) to validate normalization behavior. The implementation strategy emphasizes comprehensive edge case coverage, template-based error message validation, and robust input validation with descriptive error messages.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**‚Üí Inbound:**
- `jesse_framework_mcp.helpers.async_http_formatter:XAsyncContentCriticality` - content priority classification with validation

- `jesse_framework_mcp.helpers.async_http_formatter:XAsyncHttpErrorHandler` - exception-to-HTTP-status mapping functionality
- `pytest` (external library) - testing framework for comprehensive HTTP functionality validation

**‚Üê Outbound:**
- `test_http_formatting.py` - originally contained these tests before file split for organization
- `CI/CD pipeline/` - automated validation of HTTP infrastructure reliability
- `development workflow/` - ensures HTTP response generation consistency across JESSE Framework

**‚ö° System role and ecosystem integration:**
- **System Role**: Critical validation component ensuring JESSE Framework MCP server HTTP infrastructure operates correctly with proper status codes and error handling
- **Ecosystem Position**: Core testing infrastructure validating fundamental HTTP response generation and error handling mechanisms
- **Integration Pattern**: Executed by developers during development and CI/CD systems for continuous validation of HTTP functionality reliability

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

Error handling validation includes testing unknown status codes with `get_default_message()` returning "Unknown Status" for graceful degradation. Exception mapping tests validate `FileNotFoundError` maps to 404 status, `PermissionError` maps to 403 status, and generic exceptions map to 500 status with detailed error content. Content criticality validation tests invalid inputs raise `ValueError` with descriptive messages specifying valid options. Template-based error content generation handles missing parameters gracefully, and case-insensitive validation ensures robust input handling across various text formats.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The test implementation directly accesses class constants for validation, ensuring `XAsyncHttpStatus.OK == 200` and similar assertions for all supported status codes. Error handler testing creates specific exception instances and validates the three-tuple return format `(status_code, status_message, error_content)` from `detect_error_from_exception()`. Content criticality testing uses `pytest.raises()` context manager for exception validation with specific error message content verification. Template validation ensures error content generation uses proper string formatting with location and detail parameter substitution.

########### Code Usage Examples

Basic HTTP status code validation demonstrates how to verify status constants and retrieve default messages. This pattern ensures HTTP infrastructure operates with correct status codes and provides graceful handling of unknown codes.

```python
# Validate status code constants and retrieve default messages
assert XAsyncHttpStatus.OK == 200
assert XAsyncHttpStatus.get_default_message(404) == "Not Found"
assert XAsyncHttpStatus.get_default_message(999) == "Unknown Status"
```

Exception-to-HTTP-status mapping provides automatic error detection from Python exceptions for consistent HTTP response generation. This approach eliminates manual status code assignment and ensures proper error handling across the framework.

```python
# Automatic error detection from Python exceptions
exc = FileNotFoundError("File not found")
status_code, status_message, error_content = XAsyncHttpErrorHandler.detect_error_from_exception(
    exc, "file://missing.md"
)
# Returns: (404, "Not Found", "Resource not found: file://missing.md")
```

Content criticality validation demonstrates case-insensitive input handling with normalization to uppercase format. This pattern ensures consistent content classification regardless of input case variations.

```python
# Case-insensitive criticality validation
assert XAsyncContentCriticality.validate("critical") == "CRITICAL"
assert XAsyncContentCriticality.validate("InFormAtional") == "INFORMATIONAL"

# Invalid input handling
with pytest.raises(ValueError) as exc_info:
    XAsyncContentCriticality.validate("invalid")
```

### {PROJECT_ROOT}/jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_http_formatting.py

- **Ecosystem Position**: Core testing infrastructure component bridging legacy test runners with new modular test architecture
- **Integration Pattern**: Used by pytest discovery, CI/CD pipelines, and development tools requiring unified test class access without modification to existing test execution workflows

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

Handles `ImportError` exceptions when specialized test modules are missing or corrupted through comprehensive try-catch wrapping. Provides diagnostic `warnings.warn()` messaging with specific module names and helpful resolution guidance. Creates placeholder classes with descriptive docstrings preventing test discovery failures when imports fail. Handles partial import failures where some modules succeed and others fail through individual class imports. Manages circular import scenarios through relative import syntax avoiding absolute path dependencies. Provides graceful degradation maintaining test runner compatibility even with missing test modules. Handles module path resolution issues in different execution contexts through dot notation relative imports.

########## Internal Implementation Details

Implements relative import syntax `from .module_name import` requiring package context execution. Placeholder classes maintain identical names to imported classes ensuring test discovery compatibility. Documentation string uses triple-quote format with detailed module organization explanation and developer guidance.

########### Code Usage Examples

Essential patterns for test aggregation and backward compatibility maintenance. These examples demonstrate import aggregation strategies and error handling mechanisms for maintaining test suite organization.

```python
# Comprehensive import aggregation with error handling for test module organization
try:
    from .test_http_core_functionality import (
        TestHttpStatus,
        TestHttpErrorHandler,
        TestContentCriticality
    )
    from .test_http_section_formatting import (
        TestHttpStatusLines,
        TestHTTPSectionFormatting
    )
except ImportError as e:
    warnings.warn(f"Could not import split test modules: {e}")
```

Backward compatibility export list configuration ensures test discovery systems continue working without modification. This pattern maintains API stability while enabling internal reorganization.

```python
# Backward compatibility export list ensuring test discovery works unchanged
__all__ = [
    'TestHttpStatus',
    'TestHttpErrorHandler', 
    'TestContentCriticality',
    'TestHttpStatusLines',
    'TestHTTPSectionFormatting'
]
```

Placeholder class creation prevents import failures while providing clear guidance to developers. This fallback mechanism maintains test runner compatibility even when specialized modules are missing.

```python
# Placeholder class creation preventing import failures while providing guidance
class TestHttpStatus:
    """Placeholder - actual tests in test_http_core_functionality.py"""
    pass

class TestHttpErrorHandler:
    """Placeholder - actual tests in test_http_core_functionality.py"""
    pass
```

Diagnostic warning system provides specific resolution guidance for missing test modules. This approach helps developers quickly identify and resolve import issues during development.

```python
# Diagnostic warning with specific resolution guidance for missing modules
warnings.warn(
    f"Could not import split test modules: {e}. "
    "Ensure test_http_core_functionality.py, test_http_section_formatting.py, "
    "and test_http_path_integration.py are present in the tests/ directory.",
    ImportWarning
)
```

### {PROJECT_ROOT}/jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_http_path_integration.py

*Last Updated: 2025-07-05T14:14:39Z*

#### Functional Intent & Features

This file provides comprehensive test coverage for `XAsyncHttpPath` class dual-path functionality and portable path resolution within the JESSE Framework MCP server. The file validates cross-platform path variable substitution (`{PROJECT_ROOT}`, `{HOME}`, `{CLINE_RULES}`, `{CLINE_WORKFLOWS}`), HTTP formatting integration with location headers, and automatic file content loading with `Last-Modified` header generation. Key semantic entities include `XAsyncHttpPath` class for dual-path storage, `resolve_portable_path` function for variable substitution, `format_http_section` for HTTP response formatting, `tempfile` module for filesystem testing, and `pytest` framework for comprehensive test execution. The testing architecture ensures portable path resolution maintains original variable preservation while enabling filesystem operations on resolved paths.

##### Main Components

The file contains four primary test classes: `TestPortablePathResolution` validates `resolve_portable_path` function behavior with all supported environment variables, `TestHttpPath` tests `XAsyncHttpPath` class construction and dual-path functionality, `TestPathContentHandling` validates file content reading with automatic `Last-Modified` header integration, and `TestPerformanceAndEdgeCases` ensures performance with large content and special character handling. Each test class focuses on specific aspects of path resolution and HTTP integration, providing comprehensive coverage of portable path functionality, filesystem operations, and HTTP response generation.

###### Architecture & Design

The test architecture follows pytest conventions with class-based organization separating concerns by functional area. `TestPortablePathResolution` validates the foundation layer of path variable substitution, while `TestHttpPath` tests the `XAsyncHttpPath` wrapper class that inherits from `Path` while preserving original portable paths. `TestPathContentHandling` focuses on integration between file system operations and HTTP formatting, particularly automatic `Last-Modified` header generation from file modification times. The design emphasizes cross-platform compatibility testing, error condition validation, and integration testing between path resolution and HTTP response formatting components.

####### Implementation Approach

Tests utilize temporary file creation with `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` for realistic filesystem testing scenarios, ensuring proper cleanup with try-finally blocks. Path resolution testing validates variable substitution using `Path.cwd()` and `Path.home()` for environment-independent assertions. The `XAsyncHttpPath` testing strategy verifies dual-path functionality by comparing `get_original_path()` preservation against `str()` resolution results. Integration testing combines `XAsyncHttpPath` objects with `format_http_section` to validate automatic file content reading and `Last-Modified` header generation. Error handling tests cover file not found scenarios, empty content validation, and invalid type checking with specific exception assertions.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**‚Üí Inbound:**
- `jesse_framework_mcp.helpers.async_http_formatter:format_http_section` - HTTP response formatting with automatic content loading

- `CI/CD pipeline` - automated test execution validating portable path functionality
- `development workflow` - validates JESSE Framework MCP server path handling reliability

**‚ö° System role and ecosystem integration:**
- **System Role**: Critical validation component ensuring JESSE Framework MCP server handles portable paths correctly across different deployment environments
- **Ecosystem Position**: Core testing infrastructure validating fundamental path resolution and HTTP integration functionality
- **Integration Pattern**: Executed by developers during development and CI/CD systems for continuous validation of cross-platform path handling

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

Error handling tests validate `TypeError` exceptions for invalid content types passed to `format_http_section`, ensuring clear error messages specify expected types (`str` or `XAsyncHttpPath`). File system error scenarios include automatic 404 HTTP response generation when `XAsyncHttpPath` content files don't exist, and `ValueError` exceptions for empty file content validation. Unicode content testing ensures proper UTF-8 encoding with accurate byte-length calculation for international characters and emoji. Cross-platform path resolution testing handles environment variable availability and path separator differences. Performance testing validates large content handling (10KB+ content blocks) without memory issues or formatting corruption.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The test implementation uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` with explicit encoding='utf-8' for consistent cross-platform file handling. Cleanup operations utilize `unlink(missing_ok=True)` for safe temporary file removal. Path resolution validation compares resolved paths against `Path.cwd()` and `Path.home()` results for environment independence. HTTP header validation uses string parsing and regular expression matching for RFC 7231 timestamp format verification. The `XAsyncHttpPath` testing strategy accesses both `_resolved_path` internal attribute for cleanup and public methods for functionality validation. Performance tests generate large content using string multiplication for consistent memory usage patterns.

########### Code Usage Examples

Basic `XAsyncHttpPath` construction and dual-path access:
```python
# Create HttpPath with portable variable
http_path = XAsyncHttpPath("file://{PROJECT_ROOT}/.knowledge/test.md")

# Access original portable path for headers
original = http_path.get_original_path()  # "file://{PROJECT_ROOT}/.knowledge/test.md"

# Access resolved path for filesystem operations
resolved = str(http_path)  # "/actual/project/path/.knowledge/test.md"
```

Integration with HTTP formatting for automatic content loading:
```python
# HttpPath object automatically reads file content and adds Last-Modified header
result = format_http_section(
    content=XAsyncHttpPath("{HOME}/Cline/Rules/JESSE_HINTS.md"),
    content_type="text/markdown",
    criticality="CRITICAL",
    description="Framework Rules",
    section_type="framework-rule",
    location="file://{HOME}/Cline/Rules/JESSE_HINTS.md"
)
```

Portable path resolution testing pattern:
```python
# Test environment variable substitution
location = "file://{PROJECT_ROOT}/.knowledge/test.md"
resolved = resolve_portable_path(location)

# Validate variable replacement
assert "{PROJECT_ROOT}" not in resolved
assert str(Path.cwd()) in resolved
```

### {PROJECT_ROOT}/jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_http_section_formatting.py

*Last Updated: 2025-07-05T14:14:39Z*

#### Functional Intent & Features

This file provides comprehensive test coverage for HTTP section formatting and multi-section response functionality within the JESSE Framework MCP server, validating HTTP/1.1-like status line generation, content-length accuracy, and multi-part response assembly. The file ensures proper HTTP response generation through testing of `format_http_section` with automatic error detection, `format_multi_section_response` for combining sections, `extract_http_sections_from_multi_response` for content extraction, and `format_http_response` for simple API responses. Key semantic entities include `format_http_section` for individual section formatting, `XAsyncHttpPath` for file-based content loading, `XAsyncContentCriticality` for content priority validation, `HTTP_BOUNDARY_MARKER` for section separation, `CONTENT_TYPES` for media type validation, and `pytest` framework for comprehensive test execution. The testing architecture validates HTTP infrastructure through status code verification (200, 240, 241, 403, 404, 500), byte-perfect content-length calculation, and multi-section protocol definition integration.

##### Main Components

The file contains six primary test classes: `TestHttpStatusLines` validates HTTP/1.1 status line functionality with automatic error detection and manual overrides, `TestHTTPSectionFormatting` tests comprehensive HTTP section formatting with parameter validation, `TestMultiSectionResponse` validates combining multiple sections with protocol definitions, `TestExtractHttpSections` tests extraction of HTTP sections from multi-responses, `TestFormatHttpResponse` validates simple HTTP response formatting for API integration, and `TestIntegrationWithConstants` ensures proper integration with JESSE Framework constants. Each test class focuses on specific HTTP formatting aspects, providing comprehensive coverage of status handling, content formatting, section combination, and framework integration.

###### Architecture & Design

The test architecture follows pytest class-based organization with clear separation of HTTP formatting concerns across different functional layers. `TestHttpStatusLines` validates the foundation layer of HTTP status code handling with automatic error detection from filesystem exceptions, while `TestHTTPSectionFormatting` tests the core formatting layer with comprehensive parameter validation. `TestMultiSectionResponse` focuses on the aggregation layer that combines individual sections with protocol definitions, and `TestExtractHttpSections` tests the parsing layer for content extraction. The design emphasizes comprehensive edge case coverage, realistic filesystem testing with temporary files, and integration validation with framework constants for real-world compatibility.

####### Implementation Approach

Tests utilize temporary file creation with `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` for realistic filesystem error scenarios, ensuring proper cleanup with try-finally blocks and permission restoration. HTTP status line testing validates automatic error detection by creating actual Python exceptions (`FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`) and verifying appropriate status code mapping. Content-length accuracy testing employs UTF-8 encoding validation with international characters to ensure byte-perfect calculations. Multi-section response testing combines pre-formatted sections and validates protocol definition inclusion with XML-wrapped preambule functionality. The implementation strategy emphasizes comprehensive parameter validation, realistic error condition simulation, and integration testing with actual framework constants.

**‚Üê Outbound:**
- `test_http_formatting.py` - originally contained these tests before file split for organization
- `CI/CD pipeline/` - automated validation of HTTP section formatting reliability
- `development workflow/` - ensures HTTP response generation consistency across JESSE Framework MCP server

**‚ö° System role and ecosystem integration:**
- **System Role**: Critical validation component ensuring JESSE Framework MCP server HTTP section formatting operates correctly with proper status codes, content-length accuracy, and multi-section response assembly
- **Ecosystem Position**: Core testing infrastructure validating fundamental HTTP response generation, error handling, and multi-part content formatting mechanisms
- **Integration Pattern**: Executed by developers during development and CI/CD systems for continuous validation of HTTP formatting functionality across different content types and error scenarios

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

Error handling validation includes automatic status code detection with `FileNotFoundError` mapping to 404, `PermissionError` mapping to 403, and generic exceptions mapping to 500 status codes. Content validation tests empty content raises `ValueError`, empty header names/values raise descriptive errors, and whitespace-only parameters trigger appropriate validation failures. Multi-section response testing validates empty section arrays raise errors, whitespace-only sections are rejected, and protocol definition inclusion works correctly. UTF-8 content-length calculation testing ensures byte-perfect accuracy with international characters, emoji, and special characters. Permission testing handles system-dependent behavior with `pytest.skip()` for unreliable permission enforcement scenarios.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The test implementation uses `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` with explicit `encoding='utf-8'` and `delete=False` for controlled file lifecycle management. Permission testing employs `stat.S_IWRITE` for write-only permissions and `chmod()` for access control simulation. Content-length validation compares `len(content.encode('utf-8'))` against header values for byte-perfect accuracy verification. Multi-section response testing validates XML tag wrapping for preambule content and protocol definition positioning. Status line testing accesses internal `_resolved_path` attribute for cleanup operations and validates three-tuple return format from error detection methods. Header ordering validation uses line-by-line parsing to verify Content-Location and Content-Length appear before other headers.

########### Code Usage Examples

Basic HTTP section formatting demonstrates standard parameter usage with automatic 200 OK status generation. This pattern provides the foundation for all HTTP section formatting in the JESSE Framework.

```python
# Basic HTTP section formatting with automatic status detection
result = format_http_section(
    content="# Test Content\nThis is a test.",
    content_type="text/markdown",
    criticality="CRITICAL",
    description="Test Content",
    section_type="framework-rule",
    location="file://{HOME}/test.md"
)
# Generates: X-ASYNC-HTTP/1.1 200 OK with proper headers and content
```

Manual status override functionality allows complete control over HTTP status codes and error content generation. This approach enables custom error handling and specialized status scenarios.

```python
# Manual status override with custom error content
result = format_http_section(
    content="Original content",
    content_type="text/plain",
    criticality="CRITICAL",
    description="Custom Error Test",
    section_type="error-section",
    location="service://maintenance/",
    status_code=503,
    status_message="Service Unavailable",
    error_content="Service is temporarily unavailable due to maintenance."
)
# Generates: X-ASYNC-HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable with custom error content
```

Multi-section response assembly combines individual HTTP sections with automatic protocol definition inclusion. This pattern enables complex multi-part responses with proper section separation and documentation.

```python
# Multi-section response with protocol definition and preambule
section1 = format_http_section(content="Content 1", content_type="text/plain", 
                              criticality="CRITICAL", description="Section 1",
                              section_type="framework-rule", location="file://{HOME}/section1.txt")

section2 = format_http_section(content="Content 2", content_type="text/markdown",
                              criticality="INFORMATIONAL", description="Section 2", 
                              section_type="knowledge-base", location="file://{HOME}/section2.md")

result = format_multi_section_response(section1, section2, 
                                     preambule="Important contextual information")
# Generates: Multi-part response with XML-wrapped preambule and protocol definition
```

### {PROJECT_ROOT}/jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_new_resources.py

*Last Updated: 2025-07-05T14:14:39Z*

#### Functional Intent & Features

This test script validates knowledge resource functionality for the JESSE Framework MCP Server, specifically testing README.md resources in the `.knowledge/` directory structure. The script provides automated validation of knowledge base file existence, content verification, and resource registration processes for MCP server integration. Key semantic entities include `test_git_clones_readme()`, `test_pdf_knowledge_readme()`, `test_resource_registration()` functions, `register_knowledge_resources` import, `asyncio` async execution framework, `pathlib.Path` file system operations, and `.knowledge/git-clones/README.md` and `.knowledge/pdf-knowledge/README.md` file paths. The testing framework enables developers to verify that knowledge base resources are properly accessible through the MCP server with appropriate content validation and graceful handling of missing directories.

##### Main Components

The script contains three primary async test functions: `test_git_clones_readme()` for validating git clones knowledge base README file, `test_pdf_knowledge_readme()` for PDF knowledge directory validation, and `test_resource_registration()` for verifying MCP resource registration. The `main()` function orchestrates sequential test execution with formatted console output. Each test function implements file existence checking, content validation, and expected content pattern matching with emoji-based status reporting for visual test result differentiation.

###### Architecture & Design

The test architecture follows a sequential validation pattern where individual knowledge resources are tested independently before validating the overall registration process. The design implements file system validation using `os.path.exists()` checks combined with content analysis for expected headers and knowledge base references. The script uses graceful degradation for missing directories, treating them as expected conditions for new installations rather than failures. Error isolation ensures that individual test failures do not prevent execution of subsequent tests.

####### Implementation Approach

The testing strategy employs direct file system access using `os.path.exists()` and file reading operations with UTF-8 encoding for content validation. Content verification uses string containment checks for expected headers like "Git Clone Knowledge Bases Index" and knowledge base references like "FastMCP" and "Cline". The implementation includes character counting for content size validation and pattern matching for structural verification. Resource registration testing uses direct function calls to `register_knowledge_resources()` with exception handling for registration failures.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**‚Üí Inbound:**
- `jesse_framework_mcp.resources.knowledge:register_knowledge_resources` - knowledge resource registration function
- `jesse_framework_mcp.main:server` - MCP server instance for integration context

- `pathlib.Path` (stdlib) - file system path manipulation
- `os` (stdlib) - file existence and directory operations
- `.knowledge/git-clones/README.md` - git clones knowledge base index file
- `.knowledge/pdf-knowledge/README.md` - PDF knowledge base index file

**‚Üê Outbound:**
- Test execution reports consumed by developers for validation
- Console output with emoji-based status indicators for debugging
- Validation results for CI/CD pipeline integration

**‚ö° System role and ecosystem integration:**
- **System Role**: Validation component ensuring knowledge base resources are properly configured and accessible through MCP server endpoints
- **Ecosystem Position**: Supporting test infrastructure for JESSE Framework knowledge management system validation
- **Integration Pattern**: Executed by developers during development and automated testing pipelines to verify knowledge resource availability and content integrity

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The script handles multiple edge cases including missing knowledge directories (treated as expected for new installations), missing README files (with appropriate warning messages), and content validation failures when expected headers or references are absent. Exception handling includes comprehensive error catching with string representation of exceptions for debugging. The testing framework differentiates between critical failures (registration errors) and expected conditions (missing PDF knowledge directory) using different emoji indicators and message types.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The test functions implement emoji-based status reporting using Unicode characters (`‚úÖ`, `‚ùå`, `‚ö†Ô∏è`) for immediate visual feedback on test results. File content validation includes character counting with length reporting and specific string pattern matching for expected content elements. The script uses UTF-8 encoding explicitly for file reading operations to handle international characters in knowledge base content. Resource registration testing validates that the registration process completes without exceptions rather than testing specific registration outcomes.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Basic knowledge resource file validation pattern:**

This code demonstrates file existence checking and content validation for knowledge base resources. It provides a foundation for testing README files in knowledge directories with appropriate error handling.

```python
# Test file existence and content validation for knowledge resources
readme_path = ".knowledge/git-clones/README.md"
if os.path.exists(readme_path):
    with open(readme_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        content = f.read()
    if "Git Clone Knowledge Bases Index" in content:
        print("‚úÖ Git clones README contains expected header")
```

**Resource registration validation for MCP server integration:**

This pattern validates that knowledge resources register successfully with the MCP server. It ensures the registration process completes without exceptions and provides appropriate error reporting.

```python
# Validate that knowledge resources register successfully with MCP server
try:
    register_knowledge_resources()
    print("‚úÖ Knowledge resources registered successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"‚ùå Resource registration test failed: {str(e)}")
```

**Sequential test execution with formatted output:**

This approach orchestrates comprehensive knowledge resource validation with visual formatting. It provides structured test execution with clear section boundaries for debugging purposes.

```python
# Execute comprehensive knowledge resource validation suite
async def main():
    print("=" * 60)
    print("TESTING NEW WRITABLE RESOURCES")
    await test_git_clones_readme()
    await test_pdf_knowledge_readme()
    await test_resource_registration()
```

### {PROJECT_ROOT}/jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_orphaned_cleanup.py

*Last Updated: 2025-07-05T14:14:39Z*

#### Functional Intent & Features

This test suite validates the `OrphanedAnalysisCleanup` component functionality within the Jesse Framework MCP system, ensuring proper identification and removal of orphaned analysis files and knowledge files from knowledge base directory structures. The module provides comprehensive test coverage for cleanup operations that maintain synchronization between source code directories and their corresponding analysis artifacts. Key semantic entities include `OrphanedAnalysisCleanup` class, `IndexingConfig` model, `FastMCP` context integration, `pytest` fixtures for `temp_directories` and `indexing_config`, analysis file patterns (`.analysis.md`), knowledge file patterns (`_kb.md`), and leaf-first directory traversal algorithms. The test suite validates critical cleanup scenarios including orphaned file detection, directory preservation logic, and source-to-knowledge mapping integrity.

##### Main Components

The test suite contains `TestOrphanedAnalysisCleanup` class with six comprehensive test methods covering different cleanup scenarios. Primary fixtures include `temp_directories` for creating isolated test environments with source and knowledge directory structures, `indexing_config` for `IndexingConfig` instantiation, and `mock_context` for `FastMCP` context simulation. Test methods validate `cleanup_orphaned_files` functionality, `_collect_directories_leaf_first` ordering, analysis file cleanup with `.analysis.md` extension matching, knowledge file cleanup with `_kb.md` pattern recognition, directory preservation logic, and empty directory removal strategies.

###### Architecture & Design

The test architecture follows `pytest` fixture-based dependency injection pattern with temporary filesystem isolation using `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`. Each test creates controlled directory structures mirroring real-world knowledge base layouts with `source_root`, `knowledge_root`, and `project_base` hierarchies. The design employs `AsyncMock` for `FastMCP` context simulation, enabling async test execution without external dependencies. Test isolation ensures each scenario operates on independent filesystem structures, preventing cross-test contamination while validating specific cleanup behaviors.

####### Implementation Approach

Tests implement filesystem manipulation using `pathlib.Path` operations for cross-platform compatibility. The approach creates realistic directory structures with corresponding source files, analysis artifacts, and knowledge files to simulate production scenarios. Key algorithms tested include orphaned file detection through source-to-analysis mapping, leaf-first directory traversal for safe deletion ordering, and directory emptiness validation. Each test method follows arrange-act-assert pattern with explicit filesystem setup, cleanup operation execution, and result verification through file existence checks and statistics validation.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

- **System Role**: Quality assurance component ensuring `OrphanedAnalysisCleanup` reliability within Jesse Framework MCP knowledge base management system
- **Ecosystem Position**: Core testing infrastructure supporting knowledge base indexing and cleanup operations
- **Integration Pattern**: Executed by developers during development cycles and automated testing pipelines for continuous integration validation

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The test suite covers critical edge cases including cleanup operations on empty directory structures, preservation of directories containing valid analysis files, handling of nested directory hierarchies with mixed content states, and scenarios where source directories exist without corresponding analysis files. Tests validate proper handling of missing source files with existing analysis artifacts, empty mirrored directories with and without corresponding source directories, and leaf-first directory deletion ordering to prevent filesystem inconsistencies. Error scenarios include filesystem permission issues, concurrent access patterns, and malformed directory structures.

########## Internal Implementation Details

Internal test mechanics utilize `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` context managers for automatic cleanup, `pathlib.Path` object manipulation for filesystem operations, and `AsyncMock` specification matching for `FastMCP` context simulation. The `temp_directories` fixture creates standardized directory structures with `temp_root`, `source_root`, `knowledge_root`, and `project_base` paths. File creation uses `write_text()` methods with realistic content patterns matching production analysis and knowledge file formats. Statistics validation checks `analysis_files_deleted`, `knowledge_files_deleted`, `directories_deleted`, and `total_items_deleted` counters for comprehensive cleanup verification.

########### Code Usage Examples

Essential test execution pattern for validating orphaned analysis cleanup:

```python
# Basic cleanup test setup and execution
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_cleanup_orphaned_analysis_files(self, temp_directories, indexing_config, mock_context):
    source_root = temp_directories['source_root']
    project_base = temp_directories['project_base']
    
    # Create orphaned analysis file without corresponding source
    orphaned_analysis = project_base / "deleted_file.py.analysis.md"
    orphaned_analysis.write_text("# Analysis of deleted_file.py")
    
    # Execute cleanup operation
    cleanup = OrphanedAnalysisCleanup(indexing_config)
    stats = await cleanup.cleanup_orphaned_files(
        temp_directories['knowledge_root'], 
        source_root, 
        mock_context
    )
    
    # Verify cleanup results
    assert stats.analysis_files_deleted == 1
    assert not orphaned_analysis.exists()
```

Fixture usage pattern for test environment setup:

```python
# Temporary directory fixture for isolated testing
@pytest.fixture
def temp_directories():
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
        temp_path = Path(temp_dir)
        source_root = temp_path / "source"
        knowledge_root = temp_path / "knowledge"
        project_base = knowledge_root / "project-base"
        
        # Create directory structure
        source_root.mkdir()
        knowledge_root.mkdir()
        project_base.mkdir()
        
        yield {
            'temp_root': temp_path,
            'source_root': source_root,
            'knowledge_root': knowledge_root,
            'project_base': project_base
        }
```

### {PROJECT_ROOT}/jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_project_base_indexing_rule.py

*Last Updated: 2025-07-05T14:14:39Z*

#### Functional Intent & Features

This file provides comprehensive testing capabilities for the Jesse Framework's project-base indexing business rule implementation, validating that knowledge files are consistently stored in `{PROJECT_ROOT}/.knowledge/project-base/` directory structure with proper directory mirroring regardless of configuration settings. The test suite validates the mandatory project-base subdirectory enforcement through `KnowledgeBuilder` class from `jesse_framework_mcp.knowledge_bases.indexing.knowledge_builder` and `IndexingConfig` model from `jesse_framework_mcp.knowledge_bases.models.indexing_config`. Key semantic entities include `test_project_base_indexing_path_rule` function, `test_business_rule_configuration_detection` function, `test_mandatory_project_base_subdirectory` function, `enable_project_base_indexing` configuration flag, `enable_git_clone_indexing` configuration flag, `_get_knowledge_file_path` method validation, `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` context manager, and comprehensive emoji-based test reporting (‚úÖ, ‚ùå, üéâ, üí•). The testing framework implements business rule validation ensuring no backward compatibility exists and project-base subdirectory usage is mandatory across all configuration scenarios.

##### Main Components

The file contains three primary test functions: `test_project_base_indexing_path_rule` validates the core business rule with five sub-tests covering enabled/disabled configurations, multi-level directory structures, fallback behavior, and flat structure scenarios, `test_business_rule_configuration_detection` verifies that `IndexingConfig` properly handles the `enable_project_base_indexing` flag detection, and `test_mandatory_project_base_subdirectory` confirms that both enabled and disabled configurations produce identical project-base subdirectory paths. The main execution block orchestrates all test functions with comprehensive success/failure reporting and proper exit code handling. Each test function uses temporary directory structures created via `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` to simulate realistic project environments without affecting the actual filesystem.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture follows a comprehensive business rule validation pattern that tests both positive and negative scenarios to ensure the mandatory project-base indexing behavior is correctly implemented across all configuration combinations. The design implements isolated test environments using temporary directories to prevent side effects, while the sequential test execution pattern provides clear validation steps with immediate feedback through emoji-based status indicators. The structure separates concerns between path resolution testing, configuration detection validation, and mandatory behavior verification, enabling developers to identify specific failure points in the indexing business rule implementation. The test design emphasizes the elimination of backward compatibility by validating that both enabled and disabled configurations produce identical project-base subdirectory paths.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` context managers to create isolated test environments that mirror realistic project structures with source roots, nested directories, and knowledge output locations. The testing strategy employs direct method invocation on `KnowledgeBuilder._get_knowledge_file_path` to validate path resolution logic without requiring full indexing operations, comprehensive path comparison using `pathlib.Path` objects for cross-platform compatibility, and detailed logging with expected versus actual path reporting. The approach implements five distinct test scenarios within the main business rule test including structure mirroring, fallback behavior, and flat structure handling, while using boolean return values for test result aggregation and proper exit code generation for CI/CD integration.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**‚Üí Inbound:**
- `jesse_framework_mcp.knowledge_bases.indexing.knowledge_builder:KnowledgeBuilder` - core knowledge indexing builder class
- `jesse_framework_mcp.knowledge_bases.models.indexing_config:IndexingConfig` - indexing configuration model
- `tempfile` (external library) - temporary directory creation for isolated testing
- `shutil` (external library) - file system operations and cleanup

**‚Üê Outbound:**
- Direct script execution via `python test_project_base_indexing_rule.py` - standalone business rule validation
- Console output for developer testing sessions - formatted test results with emoji indicators
- Exit code 0/1 for CI/CD pipeline integration - automated testing validation

**‚ö° System role and ecosystem integration:**
- **System Role**: Serves as the critical business rule validator for Jesse Framework's knowledge base indexing system, ensuring mandatory project-base subdirectory usage across all configuration scenarios
- **Ecosystem Position**: Core testing component that validates the fundamental indexing behavior that all knowledge base operations depend on, particularly the elimination of backward compatibility for directory structure
- **Integration Pattern**: Used by developers during knowledge base feature development, CI/CD pipelines for regression testing, and system administrators validating indexing configuration changes before deployment

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The test suite handles multiple edge case scenarios including unrelated directory paths that cannot be resolved relative to the source root (testing fallback behavior to use directory name directly), missing source root parameters that should trigger flat structure generation, multi-level nested directory structures that must preserve the complete path hierarchy within project-base/ subdirectory, and configuration mismatches where disabled project-base indexing should still enforce project-base/ subdirectory usage. The comprehensive validation approach uses path comparison with detailed logging of expected versus actual results, boolean return aggregation to track overall test success, and proper exception handling within the temporary directory context managers. The test design specifically validates that the business rule eliminates backward compatibility by ensuring both enabled and disabled configurations produce identical project-base/ subdirectory paths.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The test functions use `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` as context managers to ensure automatic cleanup of test environments, with structured directory creation using `pathlib.Path.mkdir(parents=True)` for nested directory hierarchies. The path validation logic compares `pathlib.Path` objects directly for exact matching, while the test reporting uses structured print statements with section dividers and emoji prefixes for visual parsing during development. The configuration testing creates multiple `IndexingConfig` instances with different flag combinations to validate proper attribute handling, and the main execution block implements comprehensive success tracking with boolean aggregation and detailed final reporting. The temporary directory structure mirrors realistic project layouts with source roots, nested component directories, and knowledge output locations to ensure test scenarios match production usage patterns.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Direct execution for business rule validation:**

This command runs the complete business rule test suite to validate project-base indexing behavior. The test execution provides comprehensive validation of mandatory subdirectory usage across all configuration scenarios.

```bash
# Run complete business rule test suite
python test_project_base_indexing_rule.py
```

**Testing project-base indexing path resolution with temporary directories:**

This pattern demonstrates how the test validates path resolution behavior using isolated temporary environments. The approach ensures that knowledge files are correctly placed in the project-base/ subdirectory structure.

```python
# Example of how the test validates path resolution behavior
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
    temp_path = Path(temp_dir)
    knowledge_dir = temp_path / ".knowledge"
    source_root = temp_path / "project"
    test_directory = source_root / "src" / "components"
    
    config = IndexingConfig(
        knowledge_output_directory=knowledge_dir,
        enable_project_base_indexing=True
    )
    builder = KnowledgeBuilder(config)
    knowledge_path = builder._get_knowledge_file_path(test_directory, source_root)
    # Validates mandatory project-base subdirectory usage
```

**Configuration testing pattern for business rule validation:**

This example shows how the test verifies that both enabled and disabled configurations produce identical results. The pattern validates the elimination of backward compatibility in the indexing system.

```python
# Example of testing configuration flag behavior
project_base_config = IndexingConfig(enable_project_base_indexing=True)
regular_config = IndexingConfig(enable_project_base_indexing=False)
# Both configurations should produce identical project-base subdirectory paths
```

**Multi-level directory structure validation:**

This pattern demonstrates testing of deep directory structure preservation within the project-base/ subdirectory. The validation ensures complete directory hierarchy is maintained in the knowledge base structure.

```python
# Example of testing deep directory structure preservation
deep_directory = source_root / "src" / "components" / "ui" / "buttons"
deep_path = builder._get_knowledge_file_path(deep_directory, source_root)
expected_deep_path = knowledge_dir / "project-base" / "src" / "components" / "ui" / "buttons" / "buttons_kb.md"
# Ensures complete directory hierarchy is preserved within project-base subdirectory
```

The file contains two primary components: `MockContext` class provides FastMCP Context simulation with message categorization (`info_messages`, `debug_messages`, `warning_messages`, `error_messages`) and real-time progress monitoring, and `test_real_project_indexing()` function executes comprehensive integration testing with project structure analysis, indexing execution, and result validation. Supporting functions include `main()` for test orchestration and execution coordination. Each component focuses on specific integration testing aspects, providing comprehensive coverage of indexing system functionality, error detection, and performance analysis with real project complexity.

###### Architecture & Design

The integration test architecture follows a comprehensive validation pattern with clear separation between context simulation and indexing execution. `MockContext` implements the FastMCP Context interface with message capture and real-time display functionality, enabling detailed analysis of indexing operations. The main test function employs a multi-phase approach: project root detection with error handling, configuration setup with conservative parameters, project structure analysis with file counting, indexing execution with comprehensive monitoring, and result analysis with success criteria evaluation. The design emphasizes real-world testing conditions, comprehensive error capture, and detailed reporting for clear pass/fail determination.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation utilizes `ensure_project_root()` for dynamic project detection with comprehensive error handling for missing project environments. Configuration management employs `IndexingConfig` with conservative settings (`max_concurrent_operations=1`, `batch_size=5`, `continue_on_file_errors=True`) to ensure stable testing conditions. Project structure analysis iterates through directories using `should_process_directory()` and `should_process_file()` filters to provide accurate processing estimates. Debug artifact management creates temporary directories (`/tmp/jesse_project_indexing_integration_test`) with comprehensive cleanup and preservation for post-test analysis. Success determination employs multi-criteria evaluation including completion status, file processing rates, message analysis, and debug artifact generation.

- **Integration Pattern**: Executed by developers and CI/CD systems for comprehensive validation of indexing system reliability with actual project content and realistic processing conditions

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

Error handling includes project root detection failures with `ValueError` for missing project environments and generic `Exception` handling for unexpected detection errors. Configuration validation handles invalid parameters with descriptive error messages and fallback to conservative defaults. Indexing execution employs comprehensive exception handling with detailed error capture, message analysis, and partial result reporting even during failures. File processing errors are handled through `continue_on_file_errors=True` configuration, allowing individual file failures without stopping overall indexing. Success criteria evaluation accommodates partial failures with configurable thresholds (50% success rate minimum) and comprehensive error categorization for detailed failure analysis.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The implementation uses `datetime.now()` for precise timing measurements and duration calculations throughout indexing operations. Message capture employs separate lists for different message types with real-time `print()` statements for visual progress monitoring. Debug directory management uses `shutil.rmtree()` for cleanup and `mkdir(parents=True)` for creation with comprehensive error handling. File counting utilizes `rglob("*")` for recursive directory traversal with filtering through configuration methods. Success criteria evaluation employs dictionary-based validation with boolean logic and percentage calculations for comprehensive pass/fail determination. Debug artifact preservation maintains all generated files for post-test analysis and troubleshooting.

########### Code Usage Examples

Basic integration test execution demonstrates the complete testing workflow from project detection through result analysis. This pattern provides comprehensive validation of the indexing system with real project complexity.

```python
# Complete integration test execution with comprehensive monitoring
async def test_real_project_indexing():
    project_root = ensure_project_root()
    config = IndexingConfig(
        indexing_mode=IndexingMode.INCREMENTAL,
        enable_project_base_indexing=True,
        debug_mode=True,
        max_concurrent_operations=1
    )
    ctx = MockContext()
    indexer = HierarchicalIndexer(config)
    result = await indexer.index_hierarchy(project_root, ctx)
    return result.overall_status == ProcessingStatus.COMPLETED
```

MockContext implementation demonstrates FastMCP Context interface simulation with comprehensive message capture and real-time monitoring capabilities.

```python
# FastMCP Context simulation with message categorization and monitoring
class MockContext:
    def __init__(self):
        self.info_messages = []
        self.error_messages = []
    
    async def info(self, message: str) -> None:
        self.info_messages.append(message)
        print(f"INFO: {message}")
    
    async def error(self, message: str) -> None:
        self.error_messages.append(message)
        print(f"ERROR: {message}")
```

Success criteria evaluation demonstrates comprehensive validation logic with multiple criteria and detailed reporting for clear pass/fail determination.

```python
# Multi-criteria success evaluation with detailed analysis
success_criteria = {
    "Indexing completed": result.overall_status == ProcessingStatus.COMPLETED,
    "Files discovered": stats.total_files_discovered > 0,
    "Some files processed": stats.files_processed > 0,
    "No critical failure": len(ctx.error_messages) < stats.total_files_discovered
}
integration_success = all(success_criteria.values()) and files_success_rate > 50
```

### {PROJECT_ROOT}/jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_project_root.py

*Last Updated: 2025-07-05T14:14:39Z*

#### Functional Intent & Features

This file provides comprehensive testing capabilities for the Jesse Framework MCP server's project root detection and session initialization functionality, validating the core project setup workflow that enables proper MCP resource operation. The test suite validates `get_project_root`, `ensure_project_root`, `get_project_relative_path`, and `validate_project_setup` functions from `jesse_framework_mcp.helpers.path_utils`, along with `get_project_setup_guidance` from `jesse_framework_mcp.helpers.project_setup` and `get_session_init_context` from `jesse_framework_mcp.resources.session_init`. Key semantic entities include `test_project_root_detection` async function, `test_session_init_with_project_root` async function, `TestContext` mock class, `JESSE_PROJECT_ROOT` environment variable detection, `unwrap_fastmcp_function` utility integration, `argparse` command-line interface with `--dump` flag, and comprehensive emoji-based status reporting (‚úÖ, ‚ùå, ‚ÑπÔ∏è, üß™, üìã, üìä). The testing framework implements both summary and content dump modes for debugging session initialization resource generation.

##### Main Components

The file contains five primary test functions: `test_project_root_detection` validates basic project root discovery through environment variables and Git repository detection, `test_session_init_with_project_root` tests MCP resource session initialization with project context, `main` orchestrates test execution with conditional dump mode support, `parse_arguments` handles command-line argument parsing with `argparse.ArgumentParser`, and the `TestContext` class provides mock MCP context interface with async logging methods (`info`, `error`, `warning`, `debug`, `report_progress`). The test suite implements dual execution modes through the `dump_content` parameter, enabling both comprehensive testing and direct resource content inspection for debugging purposes.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture follows a modular testing pattern that separates project root detection validation from session initialization testing, enabling independent verification of each component while supporting integrated workflow testing. The design implements a mock context pattern through `TestContext` that simulates the MCP server's logging interface without requiring full server infrastructure, while the dual-mode execution pattern allows switching between comprehensive test reporting and raw resource content dumping. The structure uses progressive test numbering (üß™ Test 1-5) for clear test phase identification and implements conditional output formatting based on execution mode to support both developer debugging and automated testing scenarios.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses async/await patterns throughout to match the MCP server's asynchronous execution model, with `unwrap_fastmcp_function` handling FastMCP framework integration for testing MCP resources directly. The testing strategy employs sequential validation steps with immediate visual feedback through emoji-based indicators, comprehensive environment detection including `JESSE_PROJECT_ROOT` variable and `.git` directory traversal, and detailed result analysis with character counting and content sampling. The approach implements exception handling with `traceback.print_exc()` for debugging, command-line argument processing with help text and examples, and conditional content dumping that outputs complete resource content for integration testing.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**‚Üí Inbound:**
- `jesse_framework_mcp.helpers.path_utils:get_project_root` - core project root detection function
- `jesse_framework_mcp.helpers.path_utils:validate_project_setup` - project validation functionality
- `jesse_framework_mcp.helpers.project_setup:get_project_setup_guidance` - setup guidance generation
- `jesse_framework_mcp.resources.session_init:get_session_init_context` - MCP session initialization resource

- `argparse` (external library) - command-line argument parsing
- `pathlib.Path` (external library) - modern path manipulation

**‚Üê Outbound:**
- Direct script execution via `python test_project_root.py` - standalone testing tool
- Console output for developer debugging sessions - formatted test results and resource content
- Command-line interface with `--dump` flag - resource content extraction for integration testing

**‚ö° System role and ecosystem integration:**
- **System Role**: Serves as the primary validation tool for Jesse Framework MCP server project setup and session initialization, ensuring proper project root detection before MCP resource operation
- **Ecosystem Position**: Critical testing component that validates the foundation layer of the MCP server, particularly the project context establishment that all other MCP resources depend on
- **Integration Pattern**: Used by developers during setup validation, CI/CD pipelines for project verification, and debugging sessions when session initialization fails or returns setup guidance instead of project context

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The test suite handles multiple failure scenarios including missing project root when neither `JESSE_PROJECT_ROOT` environment variable nor Git repository detection succeeds, import failures when required helper modules or MCP resources are unavailable, session initialization failures during FastMCP function unwrapping or execution, and context interface mismatches between `TestContext` mock and actual MCP context requirements. The comprehensive exception handling uses `traceback.print_exc()` for detailed error diagnosis, while the conditional testing approach allows graceful handling of setup guidance generation when project root detection fails. The dual-mode execution pattern provides fallback debugging capabilities when normal test execution encounters issues, and the emoji-based status indicators clearly distinguish between different types of failures and warnings.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The `TestContext` class implements a minimal MCP context interface with async methods that print formatted messages using emoji prefixes, with conditional output suppression in dump mode to prevent interference with resource content extraction. The main testing functions use structured print statements with section dividers and progress indicators, implement try-catch blocks around critical operations to prevent test termination, and perform detailed analysis including character counting, content sampling, and section counting for HTTP-formatted responses. The argument parsing uses `argparse.RawDescriptionHelpFormatter` for proper help text formatting with examples, while the path manipulation leverages `pathlib.Path` for cross-platform compatibility and the Git detection implements manual directory traversal using parent directory iteration.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Direct execution for comprehensive project root testing:**
```python
# Run complete test suite with detailed output
python test_project_root.py
```

**Content dump mode for debugging session initialization resource:**
```python
# Extract complete session initialization resource content
python test_project_root.py --dump
```

**Integration pattern for testing MCP resource functions:**
```python
# Example of how the test unwraps and executes MCP resources
from utils import unwrap_fastmcp_function
session_init_func = unwrap_fastmcp_function(get_session_init_context)
result = await session_init_func(ctx)
# Provides direct access to MCP resource output for validation
```

**Mock context implementation for isolated MCP resource testing:**
```python
# TestContext class pattern for simulating MCP server context
class TestContext:
    async def info(self, message):
        print(f"‚ÑπÔ∏è  {message}")
    async def error(self, message):
        print(f"‚ùå {message}")
# Enables testing MCP resources without full server infrastructure
```

### {PROJECT_ROOT}/jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_session_init_resource.py

*Last Updated: 2025-07-05T14:14:39Z*

#### Functional Intent & Features

This test script validates the `jesse://session/init-context` meta-resource functionality for the JESSE Framework MCP Server, specifically testing comprehensive session initialization for Cline AI assistant integration. The script provides automated validation of multi-section HTTP response formatting, resource aggregation correctness, and individual component isolation testing. Key semantic entities include `get_session_init_context`, `TestContext` class, `unwrap_fastmcp_function` utility, `asyncio` async execution, `fastmcp.Context` integration, and `jesse_framework_mcp.resources` module ecosystem. The testing framework enables developers to verify that all essential project resources (framework rules, project context, WIP tasks, workflows, knowledge, gitignore) are properly aggregated into a single meta-resource endpoint with appropriate HTTP Content-Type boundaries and criticality levels.

##### Main Components

The script contains three primary async functions: `test_session_init_resource()` for comprehensive meta-resource validation, `test_individual_sections()` for isolated component testing, and `main()` for orchestrated test execution. A custom `TestContext` class provides mock context implementation with logging methods (`info`, `error`, `warning`, `debug`, `report_progress`) that simulate the MCP server context interface. The testing logic includes result analysis functionality that counts HTTP sections, verifies key resource sections, and provides detailed output sampling for debugging purposes.

###### Architecture & Design

The test architecture follows an isolation-first testing pattern where individual resource sections are validated before comprehensive integration testing. The design implements a mock context pattern using `TestContext` class to simulate the MCP server environment without requiring full server initialization. The script uses dynamic module importing and function unwrapping to test FastMCP-decorated functions directly, enabling unit-level testing of resource endpoints. Error handling is implemented at multiple levels with detailed traceback reporting and graceful degradation for individual section failures.

####### Implementation Approach

The testing strategy employs async/await patterns throughout with `asyncio.run()` orchestration for proper async context management. Function unwrapping is achieved through the `unwrap_fastmcp_function` utility to bypass FastMCP decorators and enable direct function testing. Result validation uses string analysis techniques including character counting, section boundary detection via "Content-Type:" markers, and pattern matching for expected resource sections. The implementation includes progress reporting simulation and detailed output sampling with truncated display for large responses.

- **System Role**: Critical validation component ensuring MCP server resource endpoints function correctly before deployment
- **Ecosystem Position**: Core testing infrastructure for JESSE Framework MCP server resource validation
- **Integration Pattern**: Executed by developers during development and CI/CD pipelines for automated resource endpoint validation

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The script handles multiple error scenarios including missing resource sections, empty meta-resource responses, individual section failures, and FastMCP function unwrapping errors. Exception handling includes full traceback printing for debugging with specific error categorization (test failures vs unexpected errors). The testing framework gracefully handles keyboard interrupts and provides detailed failure analysis when resource sections are missing or malformed. Individual section testing isolates failures to specific resource types, enabling targeted debugging when the comprehensive meta-resource fails.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The `TestContext` class implements emoji-based logging (`‚ÑπÔ∏è`, `‚ùå`, `‚ö†Ô∏è`, `üêõ`, `üìä`) for visual test output differentiation. Result analysis includes character counting with comma formatting, HTTP section boundary detection, and key section verification against expected patterns. The script uses dynamic module importing with `__import__` and `getattr` for flexible resource function testing. Progress reporting simulation includes percentage calculation and formatted output for testing the meta-resource's progress reporting capabilities.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Basic test execution for session initialization validation:**
```python
# Execute comprehensive session initialization test
success = await test_session_init_resource()
if success:
    print("Meta-resource validation passed")
```

**Individual resource section testing for debugging:**
```python
# Test specific resource sections in isolation
sections_to_test = [
    ("Framework Rules", "framework_rules", "get_available_rule_names"),
    ("Project Context", "project_resources", "get_project_context_summary")
]
for section_name, module_name, function_name in sections_to_test:
    module = __import__(f'jesse_framework_mcp.resources.{module_name}', fromlist=[function_name])
    test_func = getattr(module, function_name)
    unwrapped_func = unwrap_fastmcp_function(test_func)
    result = await unwrapped_func(ctx)
```

**Custom test context implementation for MCP simulation:**
```python
class TestContext:
    async def info(self, message):
        print(f"‚ÑπÔ∏è  {message}")
    
    async def report_progress(self, current, total, message):
        percentage = (current / total) * 100
        print(f"üìä [{percentage:3.0f}%] {message}")
```

### {PROJECT_ROOT}/jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_smart_compliance_debug.py

*Last Updated: 2025-07-05T14:14:39Z*

#### Functional Intent & Features

This file provides isolated debugging capabilities for the `get_gitignore_compliance_status` function within the Jesse Framework MCP server, specifically testing the smart compliance detection mechanism. The debug test validates that the `get_gitignore_compliance_status` function from `jesse_framework_mcp.resources.gitignore` can be properly imported, unwrapped via `unwrap_fastmcp_function`, and executed to detect gitignore compliance violations. Key semantic entities include `DebugContext` class, `debug_smart_compliance` async function, `get_gitignore_compliance_status` MCP resource function, `unwrap_fastmcp_function` utility, `asyncio` event loop management, and comprehensive error handling with `traceback` analysis. The test implements a structured validation approach using emoji-based status indicators (‚úÖ, ‚ùå, ‚ö†Ô∏è, üìä) for clear visual feedback during debugging sessions.

##### Main Components

The file contains three primary components: the `DebugContext` class that provides mock logging context with `info` and `error` methods for testing isolation, the `debug_smart_compliance` async function that orchestrates the complete testing workflow, and the main execution block using `asyncio.run` for direct script execution. The `DebugContext` simulates the MCP server context interface required by the compliance function, while `debug_smart_compliance` performs sequential validation steps including function import verification, unwrapping validation, execution testing, and result analysis with detailed output formatting.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture follows a test isolation pattern that decouples the compliance function from the full MCP server context, enabling focused debugging without server infrastructure dependencies. The design implements a mock context pattern through `DebugContext` to satisfy the function's interface requirements, while the sequential testing approach provides step-by-step validation with clear success/failure indicators. The structure separates concerns between context mocking, function testing, and result analysis, allowing developers to identify specific failure points in the compliance detection pipeline.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses async/await patterns throughout to match the MCP server's asynchronous execution model, with `unwrap_fastmcp_function` handling the FastMCP framework's function decoration layer. The testing strategy employs progressive validation steps with immediate feedback, comprehensive exception handling using `traceback.print_exc()` for detailed error diagnosis, and result analysis including type inspection, length measurement, and content preview. The approach prioritizes developer experience through emoji-based visual indicators and structured output formatting that clearly distinguishes between different test phases and outcomes.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

- `traceback` (external library) - Python exception stack trace analysis

**‚Üê Outbound:**
- Direct script execution via `python test_smart_compliance_debug.py` - standalone debugging tool
- Console output for developer debugging sessions - formatted test results and error diagnostics

**‚ö° System role and ecosystem integration:**
- **System Role**: Serves as an isolated testing harness for the Jesse Framework MCP server's gitignore compliance detection functionality, enabling developers to debug compliance issues without full server startup
- **Ecosystem Position**: Peripheral debugging tool that validates core MCP resource functionality outside the main server execution context
- **Integration Pattern**: Used by developers during debugging sessions to isolate and test the `get_gitignore_compliance_status` function, particularly when troubleshooting compliance detection failures or validating function behavior changes

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The debug script handles multiple error scenarios including import failures when `get_gitignore_compliance_status` or `unwrap_fastmcp_function` are unavailable, unwrapping failures if the FastMCP decoration is incompatible, execution failures during compliance function runtime, and context interface mismatches between `DebugContext` and expected MCP context. The comprehensive exception handling uses `traceback.print_exc()` to provide full stack traces for debugging, while the sequential testing approach isolates failure points to specific operations. Result validation includes empty string detection for no compliance issues versus content detection for compliance violations, with type and length analysis for unexpected return formats.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The `DebugContext` class implements a minimal interface with async `info` and `error` methods that print formatted messages, satisfying the compliance function's logging requirements without full MCP context overhead. The main debugging function uses structured print statements with emoji prefixes for visual parsing, implements try-catch around the entire testing sequence to prevent script termination, and performs detailed result analysis including `type()`, `len()`, and `repr()` inspection. The script uses `if __name__ == "__main__"` pattern for direct execution while maintaining importability, and the `asyncio.run()` call handles the async context management for the debugging session.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Direct script execution for debugging compliance detection:**
```python
# Run the debug script directly to test compliance function
python test_smart_compliance_debug.py
```

**Expected output format for successful compliance testing:**
```python
# Console output showing test progression
=== DEBUGGING SMART COMPLIANCE ===
1. Testing function import...
‚úÖ Function imported and unwrapped successfully
2. Testing function execution...
‚úÖ Function executed successfully
üìä Result type: <class 'str'>
üìä Result length: 0 chars
üìä Result preview: ''
‚úÖ No compliance issues - function returned empty string
```

**Integration pattern for testing compliance function in isolation:**
```python
# Example of how the debug script isolates and tests the compliance function
compliance_func = unwrap_fastmcp_function(get_gitignore_compliance_status)
result = await compliance_func(ctx)
# Provides detailed analysis without full MCP server context
```

### {PROJECT_ROOT}/jesse-framework-mcp/tests/test_strands_driver.py

*Last Updated: 2025-07-05T14:14:39Z*

#### Functional Intent & Features

This test script validates the `StrandsClaude4Driver` functionality for AWS Bedrock Claude 4 Sonnet integration within the JESSE Framework MCP Server ecosystem. The script provides comprehensive testing of LLM driver initialization, conversation management, caching systems, and configuration validation for production readiness verification. Key semantic entities include `StrandsClaude4Driver`, `Claude4SonnetConfig`, `ConversationMemoryStrategy`, `StrandsDriverError`, `PromptCache`, `test_basic_configuration()`, `test_driver_initialization()`, `test_conversation_management()`, `test_mock_responses()`, `test_caching_system()`, `asyncio` async execution, `logging` framework, and `strands-agents` external package dependency. The testing framework enables developers to verify AWS Bedrock integration, conversation state management, prompt caching efficiency, and driver lifecycle management without requiring live API calls during development.

##### Main Components

The script contains five primary async test functions: `test_basic_configuration()` for validating configuration creation and optimization presets, `test_driver_initialization()` for testing driver lifecycle and context manager usage, `test_conversation_management()` for conversation state and statistics validation, `test_mock_responses()` for driver structure validation without API calls, and `test_caching_system()` for independent cache operations testing. The `run_all_tests()` function orchestrates sequential test execution with comprehensive result reporting, while `main()` provides entry point validation for dependencies and AWS credentials. Each test function implements detailed logging with emoji-based status indicators and structured error handling for debugging purposes.

###### Architecture & Design

The test architecture follows an isolation-first testing pattern where individual components are validated independently before integration testing. The design implements comprehensive configuration testing using factory methods (`create_optimized_for_conversations()`, `create_optimized_for_analysis()`, `create_optimized_for_performance()`) for different use case scenarios. The script uses async context manager patterns for proper resource cleanup and lifecycle management. Error handling is implemented at multiple levels with specific exception catching for `StrandsDriverError` and general exception handling for unexpected failures. The testing framework provides detailed logging with structured output formatting for debugging and CI/CD integration.

####### Implementation Approach

The testing strategy employs async/await patterns throughout with `asyncio.run()` orchestration for proper async context management. Configuration validation uses boundary testing with invalid parameters to verify constraint enforcement. Driver testing implements context manager usage patterns to ensure proper initialization and cleanup sequences. Conversation management testing uses small token limits (`max_context_tokens=1000`) and summary thresholds for controlled testing environments. Cache testing employs TTL-based expiration validation and LRU eviction testing with controlled entry limits. The implementation includes comprehensive statistics collection and validation for both conversation-level and global metrics.

- **Ecosystem Position**: Core testing infrastructure for LLM driver validation and AWS Bedrock integration verification
- **Integration Pattern**: Executed by developers during development, CI/CD pipelines for automated validation, and deployment verification processes for production readiness

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The script handles multiple edge cases including missing `strands-agents` package installation (with specific pip install guidance), invalid configuration parameters (temperature bounds validation), missing AWS credentials (with environment variable setup instructions), and driver initialization failures in environments without proper AWS Bedrock access. Exception handling includes comprehensive error categorization with specific handling for `ImportError`, `StrandsDriverError`, and general exceptions. The testing framework provides graceful degradation for AWS credential issues, treating them as warnings rather than failures for structural validation. Individual test isolation ensures that failures in one test component do not prevent execution of subsequent tests.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The test functions implement emoji-based status reporting using Unicode characters (`‚úÖ`, `‚ùå`, `‚ö†Ô∏è`, `üöÄ`, `üéâ`, `üõë`) for immediate visual feedback on test results. Configuration testing includes boundary validation with temperature limits and parameter constraint verification. Driver lifecycle testing validates `is_initialized` state management and proper cleanup sequences. Cache testing implements controlled TTL expiration with `asyncio.sleep(1.1)` delays and LRU eviction validation with entry count verification. The script uses structured logging with timestamp formatting and hierarchical logger naming for debugging and monitoring integration.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Basic driver configuration and initialization pattern:**

This code demonstrates the standard pattern for configuring and initializing the Strands Claude 4 driver with proper resource management. It ensures proper cleanup and provides foundation for conversation management.

```python
# Configure and initialize Strands Claude 4 driver with context manager
config = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_performance()
async with StrandsClaude4Driver(config) as driver:
    conversation_id = "test_conversation_001"
    context = await driver.start_conversation(conversation_id)
    logger.info(f"Started conversation: {context.conversation_id}")
```

**Configuration optimization for different use cases:**

This pattern shows how to create optimized configurations for specific scenarios. It provides pre-configured settings for conversations, analysis, and performance-critical applications.

```python
# Create optimized configurations for different use cases
conversation_config = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_conversations()
analysis_config = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_analysis()
performance_config = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_performance()

logger.info(f"Conversation config - Memory strategy: {conversation_config.memory_strategy}")
logger.info(f"Analysis config - Temperature: {analysis_config.temperature}")
```

**Cache system validation and statistics monitoring:**

This approach demonstrates cache operations testing with TTL validation and eviction behavior verification. It provides foundation for monitoring cache performance and ensuring proper memory management.

#### Functional Intent & Features

This test script validates upfront cache structure preparation implementation for the JESSE Framework knowledge building system, specifically testing the `prepare_cache_structure()` method and its integration with the hierarchical indexer to eliminate race conditions during concurrent cache operations. The script provides comprehensive validation of cache directory pre-creation, race condition prevention, hierarchical indexer integration, and fallback behavior for on-demand directory creation. Key semantic entities include `FileAnalysisCache`, `HierarchicalIndexer`, `IndexingConfig`, `DirectoryContext`, `FileContext`, `ProcessingStatus`, `MockContext`, `MockKnowledgeBuilder`, `test_cache_structure_preparation()`, `test_hierarchical_indexer_integration()`, `test_fallback_behavior()`, `prepare_cache_structure()`, `get_cache_path()`, `cache_analysis()`, `get_cached_analysis()`, `_collect_all_files_recursive()`, `_discover_directory_structure()`, `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`, `asyncio.gather()`, and `.knowledge/project-base/` cache directory structure. The testing framework enables developers to verify that cache directory structures are created upfront to prevent filesystem race conditions, ensure concurrent cache operations are safe, and validate seamless integration with the knowledge building pipeline.

##### Main Components

The script contains three primary async test functions: `test_cache_structure_preparation()` for validating basic cache structure pre-creation functionality, `test_hierarchical_indexer_integration()` for testing integration with the hierarchical indexer and concurrent operation safety, and `test_fallback_behavior()` for validating on-demand directory creation when structure preparation is bypassed. The `MockContext` class provides logging simulation with message tracking, while `MockKnowledgeBuilder` extends knowledge building functionality to simulate LLM operations without external API calls. The `create_directory_context()` helper function recursively builds `DirectoryContext` instances from file lists for realistic testing scenarios. The `run_all_tests()` function orchestrates sequential test execution with comprehensive result reporting and performance metrics.

###### Architecture & Design

The test architecture follows a comprehensive validation pattern where cache structure preparation is tested at multiple levels: basic functionality, integration with hierarchical processing, concurrent operation safety, and fallback behavior validation. The design implements isolated test environments using `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` for clean filesystem testing and complex directory structure creation with nested subdirectories and files. The script uses mock inheritance patterns with `MockKnowledgeBuilder` to simulate knowledge building operations while testing cache structure preparation without external dependencies. Error handling and race condition detection employ message analysis and concurrent operation simulation using `asyncio.gather()` for parallel task execution.

####### Implementation Approach

The testing strategy employs complex directory structure creation with nested paths (`dir_i/subdir_j/file_k.py`) to simulate realistic project hierarchies and validate comprehensive cache directory preparation. Cache structure validation uses direct filesystem verification of expected cache directories based on source file paths and `get_cache_path()` resolution. Concurrent operation testing implements parallel cache operations using `asyncio.gather()` to simulate race conditions and validate thread-safe directory creation. The implementation includes recursive directory context building with parent-child relationship preservation and comprehensive error message analysis for race condition detection indicators.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The script handles multiple edge cases including missing cache directories (validated through initial state verification), concurrent directory creation attempts (tested through parallel `asyncio.gather()` operations), filesystem permission issues (graceful handling during cleanup), and fallback scenarios when structure preparation is bypassed (on-demand directory creation validation). Exception handling includes comprehensive error message analysis for race condition indicators (`FileExistsError`, `directory exists`, `cannot create directory`, `race condition`, `concurrent access`) and detailed validation of cache operation success after concurrent execution. The testing framework provides graceful handling of temporary directory cleanup failures and validates that cache operations work correctly both with pre-created structures and on-demand creation scenarios.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The test functions implement comprehensive validation using assertion-based testing with detailed filesystem state verification and concurrent operation simulation. Cache structure validation includes direct directory existence checking, expected directory set calculation based on file paths, and verification that all necessary cache directories are created before cache operations begin. Mock object creation uses simple class definitions for context simulation and knowledge builder mocking without complex external dependencies. The script includes recursive directory context building with proper parent-child relationship preservation and comprehensive message analysis for race condition detection across multiple concurrent operations.

########### Code Usage Examples

**Basic cache structure preparation with comprehensive validation:**

This code demonstrates the fundamental approach for testing upfront cache structure preparation. It validates that all necessary cache directories are created before any cache operations begin, eliminating potential race conditions.

```python
# Test comprehensive cache structure preparation with complex directory hierarchy
config = IndexingConfig(
    knowledge_output_directory=knowledge_dir,
    enable_project_base_indexing=True
)
cache = FileAnalysisCache(config)
root_context = await create_directory_context(source_root, files_created)

# Prepare cache structure upfront
await cache.prepare_cache_structure(root_context, source_root, ctx)

# Verify all expected directories were created
all_files = cache._collect_all_files_recursive(root_context)
expected_dirs = {cache.get_cache_path(file_path, source_root).parent for file_path in all_files}
missing_dirs = [dir for dir in expected_dirs if not dir.exists()]
assert len(missing_dirs) == 0, f"Missing cache directories: {missing_dirs}"
```

**Concurrent operation safety testing with race condition detection:**

This pattern demonstrates testing concurrent cache operations to validate that upfront structure preparation eliminates race conditions. It uses parallel task execution to simulate realistic concurrent scenarios.

```python
# Test concurrent cache operations safety after structure preparation
async def concurrent_cache_operation(file_path, analysis_content):
    await indexer.knowledge_builder.analysis_cache.cache_analysis(
        file_path, analysis_content, source_root
    )

# Execute multiple concurrent cache operations
tasks = [concurrent_cache_operation(file, f"Analysis {i}") for i, file in enumerate(test_files)]
await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

# Verify no race condition errors occurred
race_indicators = ["FileExistsError", "directory exists", "race condition"]
race_errors = [msg for msg in ctx.messages if any(indicator in msg for indicator in race_indicators)]
assert len(race_errors) == 0, f"Race condition errors detected: {race_errors}"
```

**Fallback behavior validation for on-demand directory creation:**

This approach demonstrates testing the fallback mechanism when cache structure preparation is bypassed. It validates that cache operations still work correctly through on-demand directory creation.

```python
# Test fallback behavior with on-demand directory creation
cache = FileAnalysisCache(config)
test_analysis = "## Fallback Test\n\nThis tests on-demand directory creation."

# Cache operation without prior structure preparation (should create directories on-demand)
await cache.cache_analysis(test_file, test_analysis, source_root)

# Verify cache file was created successfully
cache_path = cache.get_cache_path(test_file, source_root)
assert cache_path.exists(), "Cache file should exist after on-demand creation"
retrieved_analysis = await cache.get_cached_analysis(test_file, source_root)
assert retrieved_analysis == test_analysis, "Retrieved analysis should match"
```
