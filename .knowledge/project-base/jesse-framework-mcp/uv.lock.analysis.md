#### Functional Intent & Features

This file implements the UV package manager lock file for the Jesse Framework MCP Server project, providing deterministic dependency resolution and version pinning for reproducible builds across development, testing, and production environments. The lock file ensures consistent package versions and dependency trees while enabling secure and reliable package installation through cryptographic hash verification. Key semantic entities include lock file format `version = 1` and `revision = 1` for UV compatibility, Python version constraint `requires-python = ">=3.10"` for runtime compatibility, package entries with `[[package]]` sections containing dependency metadata, source registry `https://pypi.org/simple` for package distribution, hash verification through `sha256` checksums for security validation, wheel distribution files with platform-specific variants for cross-platform compatibility, dependency relationships through `dependencies` arrays linking packages, version specifications using semantic versioning patterns like `~=2.9.2` and `>=1.38.46`, development dependencies through `[package.optional-dependencies]` and `[package.dev-dependencies]` sections, editable package installation `source = { editable = "." }` for local development, and comprehensive package ecosystem including `fastmcp`, `boto3`, `strands-agents`, `mistletoe`, `pytest`, `black`, `isort`, `mypy`, and supporting libraries. The system implements UV's deterministic dependency resolution with cryptographic integrity verification ensuring reproducible and secure package installations.

##### Main Components

The lock file contains comprehensive package dependency specifications organized into multiple categories providing complete development and runtime environment definition. The runtime dependencies section includes core packages `fastmcp~=2.9.2` for MCP protocol implementation, `boto3>=1.38.46` for AWS service integration, `strands-agents>=0.1.0` for agent framework functionality, and `mistletoe>=1.4.0` for Markdown processing. The development dependencies section encompasses testing tools `pytest>=8.4.1` and `pytest-asyncio>=1.0.0`, code formatting tools `black>=22.0.0` and `isort>=5.10.0`, type checking `mypy>=0.950`, and linting `flake8>=4.0.0`. The transitive dependencies section includes supporting libraries for HTTP communication, cryptography, authentication, configuration management, and system utilities. The package metadata section defines the local `jesse-framework-mcp` package with editable installation and optional dependency groups. Each package entry contains source information, version constraints, dependency relationships, and distribution file specifications with cryptographic hashes.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements UV's lock file format with deterministic dependency resolution, following reproducible build principles with cryptographic integrity verification and cross-platform compatibility support. The design emphasizes security through hash-based verification of all package distributions, reproducibility through exact version pinning and dependency tree specification, and flexibility through optional dependency groups and platform-specific wheel selection. Key design patterns include the deterministic resolution pattern ensuring identical dependency trees across environments, cryptographic verification pattern using SHA256 hashes for package integrity validation, platform compatibility pattern providing multiple wheel variants for different operating systems and architectures, dependency graph pattern explicitly defining relationships between packages, and optional dependency pattern separating development tools from runtime requirements. The system uses UV's native lock file format with structured TOML syntax for human readability and machine processing.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses UV's lock file format version 1 with revision 1 for compatibility and feature support. Package resolution employs semantic versioning with tilde and caret constraints for compatible updates while maintaining stability. The approach implements comprehensive hash verification using SHA256 checksums for all distribution files ensuring package integrity and security. Cross-platform support uses multiple wheel variants targeting different operating systems including macOS, Linux, and Windows with architecture-specific builds. Dependency resolution follows topological sorting with conflict resolution and version constraint satisfaction. Optional dependencies use marker-based conditional installation for development and testing environments. Source specification includes both PyPI registry and local editable installation for development workflows.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The lock file addresses package resolution conflicts through UV's constraint satisfaction algorithm ensuring compatible version selection across the dependency graph. Hash verification failures are managed through package re-download and integrity checking preventing corrupted or tampered packages. Platform compatibility issues are handled through multiple wheel variants ensuring appropriate distribution selection for target environments. Network connectivity problems during package installation are addressed through retry mechanisms and fallback strategies. Version constraint conflicts between direct and transitive dependencies are resolved through UV's resolution algorithm with preference for explicit constraints. Missing package distributions are handled through alternative source selection and version fallback mechanisms. Development dependency isolation prevents runtime environment contamination through optional dependency groups and marker-based installation.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The lock file uses TOML format with structured sections for package metadata, dependency relationships, and distribution information. Package entries include name, version, source registry, dependencies array, and distribution files with cryptographic hashes. Version constraints employ semantic versioning patterns with tilde `~=` for compatible releases and greater-than-equal `>=` for minimum versions. Hash verification uses SHA256 algorithm for all wheel and source distribution files ensuring package integrity. Platform-specific wheels target multiple architectures including x86_64, arm64, and universal builds for comprehensive compatibility. Dependency markers use PEP 508 syntax for conditional installation based on Python version and platform characteristics. Optional dependency groups separate development tools from runtime requirements enabling minimal production installations.

########### Usage Examples

Package installation demonstrates the primary usage pattern for UV package manager with deterministic dependency resolution. This approach ensures identical package versions across all environments using the lock file specification.

```bash
# Install packages using UV lock file for deterministic dependency resolution
# Ensures identical package versions across development, testing, and production environments
uv sync

# Install with development dependencies for complete development environment setup
# Includes testing tools, code formatters, and type checkers for comprehensive development workflow
uv sync --dev
```

Lock file validation showcases the integrity verification pattern for secure package installation. This pattern ensures package authenticity and prevents supply chain attacks through cryptographic hash verification.

```bash
# Validate lock file integrity and package hashes for security verification
# Ensures all packages match expected cryptographic signatures preventing tampering
uv lock --check

# Update lock file with latest compatible versions while maintaining constraints
# Refreshes dependency resolution while respecting semantic versioning boundaries
uv lock --upgrade
```
