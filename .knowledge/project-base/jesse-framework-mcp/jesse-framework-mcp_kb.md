- **System Role**: Central package configuration defining the complete build, distribution, and runtime requirements for the Jesse Framework MCP Server, enabling seamless integration of JESSE framework rules with MCP protocol implementation
- **Ecosystem Position**: Core infrastructure component that bridges JESSE framework content with Python packaging ecosystem, ensuring framework rules and workflows are distributed as a standard Python package with MCP server capabilities
- **Integration Pattern**: Consumed by Python build tools for package creation, referenced by dependency managers for installation, and used by development tools for code quality assurance while coordinating build-time content embedding with runtime MCP server functionality

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The configuration addresses Python version compatibility issues through explicit `requires-python = ">=3.10"` specification ensuring FastMCP v2.9.2 compatibility requirements are met. Build hook failures are mitigated through the custom `copy_jesse_content.py` script which handles missing source content and provides error reporting during package creation. Dependency resolution conflicts are managed through version pinning strategies using compatible version specifiers (`~=` for patch-level updates, `>=` for minimum versions) preventing incompatible library combinations. Development tool configuration includes error handling through `mypy` type checking with `warn_return_any` and `disallow_untyped_defs` flags catching type-related issues. The system handles package data inclusion failures through dual configuration using both modern hatchling and legacy setuptools specifications ensuring broad compatibility across different installation environments.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The build system uses `hatchling.build` backend with custom hook integration executing during package creation to embed JESSE framework content from the `artifacts/` directory into `jesse_framework_mcp/embedded_content/`. Dependency management employs semantic versioning with `fastmcp~=2.9.2` allowing patch updates while preventing minor version changes that could introduce breaking changes. Package data configuration uses `tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.shared-data` mapping `embedded_content` to the package directory structure ensuring framework rules and workflows are included in wheel distributions. Development tooling configuration implements standardized settings with `black` line length of 88 characters, `isort` black profile compatibility, `mypy` strict type checking for Python 3.10, and `pytest` asyncio mode for testing MCP server functionality. The entry point configuration maps `jesse-framework-mcp` command to `jesse_framework_mcp:main` function enabling command-line server execution.

########### Code Usage Examples

This example demonstrates the package installation and basic usage pattern for the Jesse Framework MCP Server. The installation process includes all embedded JESSE framework content through the build-time copying mechanism.

```bash
# Install the Jesse Framework MCP Server package with all dependencies
pip install jesse-framework-mcp

```

This example illustrates the build process configuration showing how JESSE framework content is embedded during package creation. The custom build hook ensures framework rules and workflows are included in the distribution.

```toml
# Build system configuration with custom content embedding
[tool.hatch.build.hooks.custom]
path = "build_scripts/copy_jesse_content.py"

# Embedded content distribution in wheel packages
[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.shared-data]
"embedded_content" = "jesse_framework_mcp/embedded_content"
```

The system implements defensive programming with comprehensive error handling and descriptive messages while supporting all FastMCP decorator types with type safety and fallback mechanisms.

##### Main Components

The file contains four primary functions and two helper functions providing comprehensive FastMCP function unwrapping and validation capabilities. The `unwrap_fastmcp_function()` function serves as the main entry point for extracting original functions from FastMCP decorated objects with multi-pattern support. The `get_function_metadata()` function extracts comprehensive metadata from functions for debugging and validation including signature, docstring, and module information. The `validate_fastmcp_function()` function validates functions against FastMCP requirements checking async patterns, Context parameters, and documentation standards. Helper functions include `_is_fastmcp_wrapper()` for detecting FastMCP wrapper types based on class name patterns and attributes, and `_try_class_specific_extraction()` for attempting class-specific function extraction patterns for different FastMCP wrapper types. The module provides comprehensive support for `FunctionResource`, `FunctionTool`, and `FunctionPrompt` wrapper types with fallback mechanisms for unknown wrapper patterns.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements a multi-pattern extraction system with defensive programming principles, following clean separation between MCP protocol handling and direct function access with comprehensive error handling and type safety validation. The design emphasizes support for all FastMCP decorator types through attribute inspection and class-specific extraction patterns, robust wrapper detection using multiple heuristics, and comprehensive validation with clear guidance for fixing issues. Key design patterns include the extraction pattern with multiple attribute attempts for different FastMCP wrapper storage mechanisms, validation pattern providing detailed compatibility checking with specific recommendations, helper pattern separating wrapper detection and class-specific extraction logic, metadata pattern extracting comprehensive function information for analysis, and fallback pattern providing graceful degradation for unknown wrapper types. The system uses composition over inheritance with specialized functions for different aspects, comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages, and type safety with proper validation throughout the extraction process.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses attribute inspection algorithms with systematic attempts through predefined function attribute lists including `fn`, `_func`, `__wrapped__`, `func`, `_function`, `handler`, `_handler`, `callback`, `_callback`, and `read` for comprehensive extraction coverage. Wrapper detection employs class name pattern matching for FastMCP types and attribute presence checking for common wrapper characteristics. The approach implements class-specific extraction patterns for `Resource`, `Tool`, and `Prompt` wrapper types with dedicated attribute attempts for each category.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The system handles unknown FastMCP wrapper types through comprehensive attribute inspection with fallback to class-specific extraction patterns when standard attributes unavailable. Missing function attributes are managed through systematic attempts across multiple attribute names with descriptive error messages listing available attributes for debugging. Non-callable extracted objects trigger `TypeError` exceptions with specific object type information and extraction method context. Invalid function signatures are handled through `inspect.signature()` validation with warnings for functions lacking Context parameters. Wrapper detection edge cases include objects with partial FastMCP characteristics handled through conservative detection heuristics. Function metadata extraction manages missing attributes through safe fallbacks preventing extraction failures. Signature inspection failures are handled gracefully with continued execution and warning messages rather than complete failure. Class-specific extraction handles unknown class types through pattern matching with graceful None returns for unsupported wrapper types.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The module uses systematic attribute inspection with predefined lists including primary `fn` attribute for FastMCP FunctionResource objects and fallback attributes for various wrapper patterns. Wrapper detection implements class name pattern matching for `FunctionResource`, `FunctionTool`, `FunctionPrompt`, `Resource`, `Tool`, and `Prompt` patterns with attribute presence checking for `_func`, `__wrapped__`, `func`, and `_function`. Class-specific extraction employs dedicated patterns for Resource, Tool, and Prompt wrapper types with specific attribute attempts including `_func`, `handler`, `_handler`, and `callback` for each category. Function validation uses `inspect.iscoroutinefunction()` for async requirement checking and parameter analysis for Context parameter validation. Metadata extraction combines `inspect.signature()`, `inspect.getdoc()`, `inspect.getfile()`, and `inspect.getsourcelines()` with exception handling for unavailable information. Error messages include specific wrapper types, available attributes, and extraction methods for comprehensive debugging support. Type safety validation ensures callable objects with proper signatures before function return.

########### Code Usage Examples

FastMCP function unwrapping demonstrates the primary usage pattern for extracting original functions from decorated objects for direct testing. This approach enables developers to test FastMCP resources without MCP protocol overhead while maintaining full function access.

```python
# Extract original function from FastMCP decorated resource for direct testing
# Enables testing without MCP protocol complexity while preserving function behavior
from utils import unwrap_fastmcp_function

# Unwrap FastMCP resource to access underlying function
original_function = unwrap_fastmcp_function(decorated_resource)
# Direct function invocation for testing with Context parameter
result = await original_function(context, *args, **kwargs)
```

Function validation showcases the FastMCP compatibility checking pattern for ensuring proper function structure. This pattern provides comprehensive validation with specific recommendations for fixing compatibility issues.

```python
# Validate function compatibility with FastMCP requirements and get detailed feedback
# Provides comprehensive validation results with specific recommendations for fixes
from utils import validate_fastmcp_function, get_function_metadata

# Validate FastMCP function requirements
validation_result = validate_fastmcp_function(function, expected_context_param="ctx")
if not validation_result['is_valid']:
    print("Validation issues:", validation_result['issues'])
    print("Recommendations:", validation_result['recommendations'])

# Extract comprehensive function metadata for analysis
metadata = get_function_metadata(function)
print(f"Function: {metadata['name']}, Parameters: {metadata['parameters']}")
```

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The lock file addresses dependency resolution conflicts through exact version pinning and comprehensive constraint satisfaction across the entire dependency graph. Platform compatibility issues are handled through conditional dependency markers and multiple wheel distributions supporting different operating systems and architectures. Python version compatibility constraints prevent installation on unsupported Python versions through `requires-python = ">=3.10"` specification. Package integrity failures are detected through SHA256 hash verification for both wheel and source distributions. The system handles missing optional dependencies through conditional markers and graceful degradation patterns. Network connectivity issues during package installation are mitigated through multiple mirror support and cached wheel distributions. Version constraint conflicts are resolved through the lock file's deterministic resolution ensuring all transitive dependencies are compatible.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The lock file format uses TOML syntax with structured package entries containing comprehensive metadata including version specifications, source registry information, dependency relationships, and cryptographic verification data. Each package entry includes `name`, `version`, `source` registry information, `dependencies` array with conditional markers, `sdist` source distribution metadata with URL and SHA256 hash, and `wheels` array containing platform-specific wheel files with URLs and integrity checksums. Dependency resolution implements constraint satisfaction algorithms ensuring all version requirements are met across the entire dependency graph. Platform-specific handling uses conditional markers like `python_full_version < '3.11'` and `sys_platform == 'win32'` for targeted dependency inclusion. The system maintains separate dependency groups through `optional-dependencies` and `dev-dependencies` sections enabling different installation profiles for development and production environments.

########### Code Usage Examples

This example demonstrates installing dependencies using the lock file for reproducible development environment setup. The lock file ensures exact versions are installed matching the project's tested configuration.

```bash
# Install dependencies using uv with lock file for exact version matching
uv sync
# Installs all dependencies with exact versions specified in uv.lock
```

This example shows how to install only production dependencies excluding development tools. The lock file supports selective installation based on dependency groups and optional requirements.

```bash
# Install production dependencies only using lock file specifications
uv sync --no-dev
# Excludes development dependencies like pytest, black, mypy from installation
```

This example illustrates adding a new dependency while maintaining lock file integrity. The lock file must be updated to include new dependencies with proper version resolution and hash verification.

```bash
# Add new dependency and update lock file with resolved versions
uv add requests
uv lock
# Updates uv.lock with new dependency and all transitive requirements
```
