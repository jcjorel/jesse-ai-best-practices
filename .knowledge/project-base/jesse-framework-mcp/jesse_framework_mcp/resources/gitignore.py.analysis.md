#### Functional Intent & Features

This file implements dedicated gitignore compliance management for the Jesse Framework MCP Server, providing intelligent compliance checking and context-optimized session initialization through smart feature detection and conditional output strategies. The module enables comprehensive gitignore validation by detecting active framework features and providing precise remediation guidance only when compliance issues are found, supporting both smart compliance checking and legacy file access patterns. Key semantic entities include compliance data classes `ComplianceIssue`, `GitignoreComplianceResult`, and `ComplianceIssueType` enum for structured issue representation, feature detection class `FeatureDetector` with methods `detect_active_features()`, `is_git_clones_active()`, and `is_pdf_knowledge_active()` for intelligent feature scanning, validation class `GitignoreValidator` with methods `validate_compliance()`, `check_file_patterns()`, `parse_gitignore_file()`, and `generate_remediation_guidance()` for comprehensive compliance assessment, MCP resource handlers `get_gitignore_compliance_status()` decorated with `@server.resource("jesse://project/gitignore-compliance")` and `get_project_gitignore_files()` with `@server.resource("jesse://project/gitignore-files")`, pattern constants `GIT_CLONES_PATTERNS`, `PDF_KNOWLEDGE_PATTERNS`, and `MANDATORY_FILES` for compliance requirements, HTTP formatting functions `format_http_section()` and `format_multi_section_response()` with `XAsyncContentCriticality.CRITICAL` and `XAsyncContentCriticality.INFORMATIONAL` classifications, and path utilities `get_project_root()`, `ensure_project_root()`, and `get_project_relative_path()` for consistent file system operations. The system implements smart feature detection validating patterns only for active features with conditional output returning empty strings when compliant for massive context reduction and detailed guidance when issues require attention.

##### Main Components

The file contains four primary classes, two MCP resource handlers, and three pattern constant definitions providing comprehensive gitignore compliance management capabilities. The `ComplianceIssueType` enum defines issue categories including `MISSING_FILE`, `MISSING_PATTERNS`, `CONFLICTING_PATTERNS`, and `INVALID_CONTENT` for structured issue classification. The `ComplianceIssue` dataclass represents specific compliance problems with file paths, issue types, descriptions, required patterns, current patterns, and remediation actions. The `GitignoreComplianceResult` dataclass aggregates compliance assessment results including compliance status, active features set, issues list, and remediation guidance. The `FeatureDetector` class provides static methods for detecting active framework features requiring gitignore patterns through directory and file scanning. The `GitignoreValidator` class implements comprehensive compliance validation with pattern matching, file parsing, diagnostic generation, and remediation guidance creation. The `get_gitignore_compliance_status()` resource handler provides smart compliance checking with conditional output, while `get_project_gitignore_files()` maintains backward compatibility for direct file access with mandatory and optional file handling.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements a smart compliance system with feature-driven validation, following separation of concerns principles with dedicated classes for detection, validation, and issue representation. The design emphasizes conditional output strategies returning empty responses when compliant for context optimization and detailed guidance when issues require attention, smart feature detection validating only active framework components, and precise remediation with exact copy-paste solutions for non-compliance scenarios. Key design patterns include the strategy pattern for feature detection with pluggable validation logic, data class pattern for structured issue representation and compliance results, validator pattern for comprehensive compliance assessment with diagnostic capabilities, conditional output pattern optimizing context delivery based on compliance status, and resource handler pattern providing both smart compliance checking and legacy file access. The system uses composition over inheritance with specialized classes for different compliance aspects, centralized pattern definitions for consistency, and HTTP formatting integration for standardized MCP response delivery.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses feature detection algorithms scanning specific directories for active framework components including `.knowledge/git-clones/` for repository subdirectories and `.knowledge/pdf-knowledge/` for PDF files. Compliance validation employs pattern matching with exact string comparison, file parsing with UTF-8 encoding and fallback handling, and diagnostic generation providing detailed mismatch analysis. The approach implements conditional resource delivery with empty string returns for compliant systems achieving massive context reduction and comprehensive guidance generation for non-compliant scenarios. Pattern validation uses line-by-line comparison with preserved whitespace and comments for exact matching requirements. Error handling employs try-catch blocks with graceful degradation and detailed error context for debugging support. File system operations use project root detection with absolute path construction for consistent access across deployment contexts. HTTP formatting applies appropriate criticality levels with CRITICAL for compliance issues and INFORMATIONAL for status information.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The system handles missing project root through `get_project_root()` validation with specific compliance issues generated when project structure unavailable for validation operations. Feature detection manages directory access errors through try-catch blocks with graceful degradation when file system permissions prevent scanning operations. File parsing implements UTF-8 encoding with fallback to latin-1 encoding for compatibility with different file encodings and character sets. Pattern matching handles whitespace variations and comment preservation for exact compliance validation while providing diagnostic information for near-miss scenarios. Compliance validation manages individual file access failures through exception handling with detailed error context and remediation guidance. Resource handler error handling provides fallback responses with appropriate HTTP status codes and error information when compliance checking fails. Missing mandatory files trigger CRITICAL compliance issues with specific remediation actions, while optional files are handled gracefully with conditional inclusion based on existence. The smart compliance resource returns empty strings for compliant systems enabling massive context reduction in session initialization scenarios.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The module uses feature detection through directory scanning with `iterdir()` operations checking for subdirectories in `.knowledge/git-clones/` and PDF files in `.knowledge/pdf-knowledge/` with file extension filtering. Pattern validation employs exact string matching with line-by-line comparison preserving original formatting including comments and whitespace for byte-perfect compliance checking. Compliance issue generation uses dataclass instantiation with structured fields including file paths, issue types, descriptions, required patterns, current patterns, and remediation actions. Diagnostic generation implements detailed pattern analysis with missing pattern identification, similar pattern detection, and current file content display for debugging support. HTTP formatting uses specific status codes including 241 for compliance issues and 500 for validation errors with appropriate criticality levels and section types. File system operations use absolute path construction through `project_root / relative_path` patterns for consistent access across deployment contexts. Pattern constants define exact gitignore requirements with comment headers and specific ignore patterns for git clones and PDF knowledge features. Resource registration employs FastMCP decorator patterns with specific URI endpoints for compliance checking and file access functionality.

########### Code Usage Examples

Smart compliance checking demonstrates the conditional output pattern for context-optimized session initialization. This approach provides massive context reduction when compliant and detailed guidance when issues require attention.

```python
# Access smart gitignore compliance checking for context-optimized session initialization
# Returns empty string when compliant (major context reduction) or detailed guidance when issues found
compliance_status = await mcp_client.read_resource("jesse://project/gitignore-compliance")
if not compliance_status.strip():
    # Fully compliant - no action needed, massive context savings
    print("Gitignore compliance verified - no issues")
else:
    # Non-compliant - detailed remediation guidance provided
    print("Compliance issues found - review guidance")
```

Feature detection and validation showcases the intelligent compliance assessment pattern with active feature scanning. This pattern enables precise validation targeting only active framework components for efficient compliance checking.

```python
# Demonstrate feature detection and compliance validation workflow
# Provides intelligent scanning and precise remediation guidance
from jesse_framework_mcp.resources.gitignore import FeatureDetector, GitignoreValidator

# Detect active features requiring gitignore compliance
active_features = FeatureDetector.detect_active_features()
print(f"Active features: {active_features}")

# Validate compliance for detected features
validator = GitignoreValidator()
result = validator.validate_compliance()
print(f"Compliant: {result.is_compliant}")
print(f"Issues: {len(result.issues)}")

# Access detailed remediation guidance when needed
if result.remediation_guidance:
    print("Remediation guidance available")
```
