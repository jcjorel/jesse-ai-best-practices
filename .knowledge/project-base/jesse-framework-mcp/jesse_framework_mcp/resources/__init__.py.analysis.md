#### Functional Intent & Features

This file serves as the resources package initialization module for the Jesse Framework MCP Server, providing centralized registration and coordination of all FastMCP resource handlers through a modern resource-first architecture with individual resource access patterns. The module enables comprehensive resource management by orchestrating the registration of framework rules, project resources, workflows, knowledge bases, WIP tasks, and session initialization meta-resources through a single initialization point. Key semantic entities include the primary registration function `register_all_resources()` for coordinating all resource handler registrations, imported registration functions `register_framework_rules_resources()`, `register_project_resources()`, `register_workflows_resources()`, `register_knowledge_resources()`, `register_wip_tasks_resources()`, and `register_session_init_resources()` from respective resource modules, module imports from `.framework_rules`, `.project_resources`, `.workflows`, `.knowledge`, `.wip_tasks`, and `.session_init` submodules, `__all__` export list defining the public package interface with six resource module names, and comprehensive docstring documentation describing the package organization including workflows for Cline slash command integration, knowledge bases with lazy loading, WIP tasks inventory, individual JESSE rule resources, project-specific handlers, and session initialization meta-resource functionality. The system implements FastMCP auto-registration through decorators for modern transport with HTTP-formatted resource delivery ensuring consistent AI assistant processing across all resource types.

##### Main Components

The file contains one primary registration function and six module imports providing comprehensive resource management coordination capabilities. The `register_all_resources()` function serves as the central orchestrator importing and calling registration functions from all resource modules including framework rules, project resources, workflows, knowledge bases, WIP tasks, and session initialization. The module imports include `.framework_rules` for individual JESSE rule resources, `.project_resources` for project context resources, `.workflows` for HTTP-formatted workflow resources with Cline integration, `.knowledge` for external knowledge base resources with lazy loading, `.wip_tasks` for WIP task inventory and individual task resources, and `.session_init` for session initialization meta-resource combining all essential contexts. The `__all__` export list defines the public package interface exposing all six resource modules for external consumption and import management.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements a centralized registration pattern with modular resource organization, following resource-first architecture principles with individual resource handlers and FastMCP auto-registration through decorators for modern transport. The design emphasizes HTTP-formatted resource delivery for consistent AI assistant processing, modular organization for maintainability and extensibility, and comprehensive resource coverage including framework rules, project context, workflows, knowledge bases, WIP tasks, and session initialization. Key design patterns include the centralized registration pattern coordinating all resource handler registrations through a single function, modular organization pattern separating resource types into dedicated modules, auto-registration pattern leveraging FastMCP decorators for modern transport, and package initialization pattern executing registration on module import. The system uses composition over inheritance with individual resource modules handling specific functionality, centralized coordination through the main registration function, and comprehensive export management through `__all__` list definition.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses import-time registration execution through direct function call at module level ensuring all resources are registered when the package is imported. Resource coordination employs sequential registration function calls importing each resource module's registration function and executing it to register all handlers within that module. The approach implements modular import patterns with relative imports from resource submodules using dot notation for clean namespace organization. Package interface definition uses `__all__` list with six module names providing explicit control over public exports and import behavior. Error handling relies on individual resource modules for specific error management while maintaining centralized coordination. The registration sequence follows logical ordering with framework rules first, followed by project resources, workflows, knowledge bases, WIP tasks, and session initialization meta-resource last for comprehensive context delivery.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The system handles import failures through Python's standard import mechanism with potential ImportError exceptions if resource modules are missing or corrupted during package initialization. Registration function failures are managed through individual resource module error handling with potential propagation to the main registration function. Module import order dependencies are handled through sequential registration calls ensuring proper initialization sequence across all resource types. Missing registration functions trigger AttributeError exceptions during import and function call operations. The centralized registration approach provides error isolation where individual resource module failures do not prevent other resources from registering successfully. Package initialization errors during import-time registration execution can prevent the entire resources package from loading properly. The `__all__` list ensures controlled exports preventing accidental access to internal implementation details while maintaining comprehensive resource module access.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The module uses import-time execution with `register_all_resources()` function call at module level ensuring all resource handlers are registered immediately when the package is imported. Registration sequence implements specific ordering with framework rules first, followed by project resources, workflows, knowledge bases, WIP tasks, and session initialization meta-resource for logical dependency management. Relative imports use dot notation with `.module_name` pattern for clean namespace organization and consistent import behavior across the package structure. Function registration employs direct function calls to imported registration functions with no parameter passing or return value handling. Package interface definition uses `__all__` list with explicit module names including `framework_rules`, `project_resources`, `session_init`, `workflows`, `knowledge`, and `wip_tasks` for controlled public exports. Error propagation relies on Python's standard exception handling with potential failures during import or registration function execution. The module maintains minimal implementation focusing on coordination and registration with all functional logic delegated to individual resource modules.

########### Code Usage Examples

Package import demonstrates the automatic resource registration pattern triggered by importing the resources package. This approach provides complete resource handler registration through a single import operation for MCP server initialization.

```python
# Import resources package to automatically register all resource handlers
# Triggers registration of framework rules, project resources, workflows, knowledge bases, WIP tasks, and session initialization
from jesse_framework_mcp import resources
# All resource handlers are now registered with the FastMCP server instance
```

Individual resource module access showcases the modular organization pattern for specific resource type operations. This pattern enables targeted resource module usage while maintaining the centralized registration coordination.

```python
# Access individual resource modules for specific functionality
# Provides direct access to resource module components while maintaining registration coordination
from jesse_framework_mcp.resources import framework_rules, project_resources, workflows
from jesse_framework_mcp.resources import knowledge, wip_tasks, session_init

# Individual modules provide specific resource handler functionality
# All modules are automatically registered through package initialization
```
