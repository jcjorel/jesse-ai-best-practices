#### Functional Intent & Features

This file implements session management helper functions for the Jesse Framework MCP Server, focusing on resource access logging and WIP task context utilities with lightweight operations designed for resource implementations without heavy session management overhead. The module enables resource-focused logging for analytics and usage tracking while providing simple WIP task context utilities for MCP resource implementations. Key semantic entities include `load_wip_task_context_async()` for current WIP task loading, `get_current_wip_task_name_async()` for active task identification, `log_resource_access()` for resource analytics tracking, `FastMCP Context` for async operations and progress reporting, `.knowledge/work-in-progress/` directory structure access, `.knowledge/persistent-knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` parsing, `.coding_assistant/jesse/` logging directory creation, `WIP_TASK.md` and `PROGRESS.md` file loading, `resource_access.log` JSON logging, Essential Knowledge Base configuration integration, and privacy-conscious logging patterns without sensitive content capture. The system implements resource-first architecture with simplified logging and WIP task utilities supporting MCP resource implementations.

##### Main Components

The file contains three primary async functions providing WIP task management and resource logging capabilities. The `load_wip_task_context_async()` function loads current WIP task context by reading the active task from `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` and loading corresponding `WIP_TASK.md` and `PROGRESS.md` files from the work-in-progress directory with comprehensive progress reporting. The `get_current_wip_task_name_async()` function extracts the current WIP task name through simple parsing of the knowledge base file, scanning for "Current Work-in-Progress Task" sections and "Active Task" field identification. The `log_resource_access()` function provides lightweight resource access logging with timestamped JSON entries for analytics and usage tracking, creating log entries in the `.coding_assistant/jesse/` directory without capturing sensitive content.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements resource-focused design patterns with lightweight operations optimized for MCP resource implementations rather than heavy session management. The design follows async-first principles with comprehensive FastMCP Context integration for progress reporting and error handling throughout all operations. Key design patterns include the utility function pattern for resource support operations, lightweight logging pattern for analytics without session overhead, WIP task context loading pattern based on Essential Knowledge Base configuration, and privacy-conscious logging pattern avoiding sensitive content capture. The system uses simple file-based operations with structured directory access patterns and JSON-based logging for resource usage analytics.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses file-based WIP task loading with sequential file access patterns for `WIP_TASK.md` and `PROGRESS.md` files from task-specific directories. WIP task identification employs simple string parsing of the knowledge base file, scanning line-by-line for "**Active Task**:" markers and extracting task names with basic validation. Resource logging uses JSON serialization with timestamped entries appended to log files in the `.coding_assistant/jesse/` directory structure. The approach implements comprehensive error handling with Context integration for progress reporting and error logging without breaking resource access operations. Directory creation uses `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` patterns for reliable log directory establishment.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**→ Inbound:**
- `json` (external library) - JSON serialization for resource access logging and structured data handling
- `datetime` (external library) - timestamp generation for resource access tracking and log entry creation
- `pathlib.Path` (external library) - cross-platform filesystem operations for directory and file access
- `fastmcp:Context` - FastMCP context providing progress reporting, error logging, and async operation support
- `typing.Optional` (external library) - type annotations for optional return values and parameter specifications

**← Outbound:**
- Jesse Framework MCP resource implementations - consuming WIP task context utilities for dynamic content loading
- MCP server resource endpoints - using resource access logging for analytics and usage pattern tracking
- Resource analytics systems - consuming JSON log entries from resource_access.log for usage analysis
- WIP task management workflows - using task context loading for active task integration

**⚡ System role and ecosystem integration:**
- **System Role**: Lightweight session management infrastructure for Jesse Framework MCP server, providing resource-focused utilities for WIP task context loading and resource access analytics without heavy session overhead
- **Ecosystem Position**: Peripheral support component serving MCP resource implementations and analytics systems, bridging WIP task management with resource access patterns
- **Integration Pattern**: Used by MCP resource implementations for WIP task context loading, consumed by analytics systems for resource usage tracking, and integrated with Essential Knowledge Base configuration for active task identification

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The system handles missing knowledge base files by returning None values and providing informative Context logging when files cannot be accessed. WIP task directory validation checks for existence before attempting file loading and provides detailed error messages when directories are missing. File access errors during WIP task loading are caught and converted to error messages without breaking resource operations. Resource logging failures are handled gracefully without raising exceptions to prevent logging issues from breaking resource access. Empty or malformed knowledge base content is managed through simple parsing with fallback to None values when active tasks cannot be identified. Directory creation failures for logging are handled through comprehensive exception management with Context error reporting.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The WIP task loading uses sequential file access with UTF-8 encoding and structured content formatting using section delimiters for clear content organization. Knowledge base parsing employs line-by-line scanning with string splitting on "**Active Task**:" markers and basic validation for non-empty task names. Resource logging uses JSON serialization with ISO timestamp formatting and append-mode file operations for persistent log accumulation. Directory operations use `pathlib.Path` with `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)` for reliable directory creation and existence checking. Error handling implements comprehensive try-catch blocks with Context integration for detailed error reporting and graceful degradation. The system maintains lightweight operation patterns without session state management or complex data structures.

########### Code Usage Examples

WIP task context loading demonstrates the pattern for resource implementations requiring active task information. This approach provides comprehensive task context with progress reporting and error handling for MCP resource integration.

```python
# Load current WIP task context for resource implementations with progress reporting
async def get_wip_context_for_resource(ctx: Context):
    wip_context = await load_wip_task_context_async(ctx)
    return wip_context
    # Returns formatted WIP task content with WIP_TASK.md and PROGRESS.md sections
    # Includes comprehensive error handling and Context progress reporting
```

Resource access logging showcases the analytics pattern for tracking resource usage without breaking operations. This pattern enables usage analytics while maintaining privacy-conscious logging practices and graceful error handling.

```python
# Log resource access for analytics with graceful error handling
async def track_resource_usage(resource_uri: str, ctx: Context):
    await log_resource_access(resource_uri, ctx)
    # Creates timestamped JSON log entry in .coding_assistant/jesse/resource_access.log
    # Logging failures don't break resource access operations
    # Privacy-conscious logging without sensitive content capture
```
