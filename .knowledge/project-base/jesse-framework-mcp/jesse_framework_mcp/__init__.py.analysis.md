#### Functional Intent & Features

This file implements the package initialization for the Jesse Framework MCP Server, providing the primary entry point and version information for the complete self-contained JESSE framework distribution. The module serves as the public interface for the MCP server package, enabling both console script execution and programmatic usage through standardized Python packaging patterns. Key semantic entities include package metadata constants `__version__ = "0.1.0"`, `__author__ = "JESSE Framework"`, and `__email__ = "contact@jesse-framework.dev"` for distribution identification, main entry point import `from .main import main` providing access to the FastMCP server implementation, export list `__all__ = ["main", "__version__"]` defining the public API surface, comprehensive docstring describing MCP server capabilities including `jesse_start_session` and `jesse_load_knowledge_base` functionality, usage examples for both command-line execution via `jesse-framework-mcp` console script and programmatic access through `asyncio.run(main())`, and build-time embedded content support for complete framework distribution. The system implements Python packaging standards for MCP server distribution with async main entry point compatibility for FastMCP stdio transport protocol while maintaining Python 3.8+ compatibility for broad deployment support.

##### Main Components

The file contains package metadata definitions, one primary import statement, one export list, and comprehensive documentation providing complete package initialization functionality. The package metadata includes `__version__`, `__author__`, and `__email__` constants establishing package identity and contact information for distribution. The main import statement `from .main import main` provides access to the FastMCP server implementation from the main module. The export list `__all__ = ["main", "__version__"]` defines the public API surface limiting exposed functionality to essential components. The module docstring provides comprehensive documentation describing MCP server capabilities, usage patterns, and integration examples for both console script and programmatic access scenarios.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements a standard Python package initialization pattern with clean separation between public API surface and internal implementation details, following Python packaging standards for MCP server distribution. The design emphasizes simplicity through minimal package initialization with clear version and entry point exports, async compatibility through main entry point wrapper for FastMCP stdio transport, and comprehensive documentation providing usage guidance for different deployment scenarios. Key design patterns include the package initialization pattern establishing public API through `__all__` exports, entry point delegation pattern importing main functionality from implementation module, metadata definition pattern providing package identity through standard Python package attributes, and documentation pattern providing comprehensive usage examples for both command-line and programmatic access. The system uses standard Python packaging conventions with minimal complexity while maintaining compatibility requirements for MCP protocol integration.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses standard Python package initialization with direct import delegation to the main module through `from .main import main` statement. Package metadata employs standard Python conventions with string constants for `__version__`, `__author__`, and `__email__` attributes. Public API definition uses `__all__` list containing `["main", "__version__"]` to explicitly control exported symbols. The approach implements comprehensive documentation through module docstring including usage examples for console script execution and programmatic access patterns. Entry point compatibility maintains async support through delegation to main module implementation while providing synchronous package-level interface. Documentation includes specific usage patterns with command-line execution via `jesse-framework-mcp` and programmatic execution through `asyncio.run(main())` for different deployment scenarios.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**→ Inbound:**
- `.main:main` - main FastMCP server implementation providing complete MCP protocol functionality and resource handlers
- `asyncio` (external library) - async event loop support for MCP protocol execution referenced in documentation examples

**← Outbound:**
- Console script systems - consuming package entry point through `jesse-framework-mcp` command for MCP server execution
- Python import systems - accessing package functionality through `import jesse_framework_mcp` for programmatic usage
- Package distribution systems - using package metadata for PyPI distribution and dependency management
- MCP client applications - connecting to server through stdio transport for JESSE framework functionality
- Build systems - accessing package structure for embedded content integration and distribution packaging

**⚡ System role and ecosystem integration:**
- **System Role**: Package initialization interface for Jesse Framework MCP Server ecosystem, providing standardized entry point and metadata for complete framework distribution with MCP protocol compliance
- **Ecosystem Position**: Core package interface serving as primary access point for all JESSE framework functionality, bridging between Python packaging standards and MCP server implementation
- **Integration Pattern**: Used by package managers for distribution metadata, consumed by console script systems for command-line execution, accessed by Python applications for programmatic integration, and coordinated with build systems for embedded content packaging and deployment

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The system handles import failures through standard Python import mechanisms with potential ImportError exceptions if main module unavailable during package initialization. Package metadata access manages missing attributes through standard Python attribute access patterns with AttributeError exceptions for undefined package information. Console script execution handles async compatibility through delegation to main module implementation managing event loop creation and MCP protocol initialization. Documentation examples handle execution failures through standard asyncio exception handling patterns for event loop management. Package initialization manages missing dependencies through import-time error propagation preventing package loading when core functionality unavailable. The minimal implementation approach reduces error surface area by delegating complex functionality to main module while maintaining standard Python packaging error handling patterns.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The module uses direct import delegation with `from .main import main` providing access to FastMCP server implementation without additional wrapper logic. Package metadata employs string literal assignments with `__version__ = "0.1.0"`, `__author__ = "JESSE Framework"`, and `__email__ = "contact@jesse-framework.dev"` following Python packaging conventions. Public API definition uses list literal `__all__ = ["main", "__version__"]` explicitly controlling symbol exports for package consumers. Module docstring implements triple-quoted string with comprehensive documentation including package description, feature overview, and usage examples for different deployment scenarios. The implementation maintains minimal complexity with no additional logic beyond standard Python package initialization patterns while providing complete interface for MCP server functionality access.

########### Code Usage Examples

Console script execution demonstrates the primary deployment pattern for Jesse Framework MCP Server with command-line interface. This approach provides standardized MCP server execution through package console script integration.

```bash
# Execute Jesse Framework MCP Server through console script for MCP protocol communication
# Provides complete JESSE framework functionality over stdio transport
$ jesse-framework-mcp
# Server runs with FastMCP stdio transport for MCP client communication
```

Programmatic usage showcases the integration pattern for embedding Jesse Framework MCP Server within Python applications. This pattern enables custom MCP server deployment with application-specific configuration and lifecycle management.

```python
# Integrate Jesse Framework MCP Server programmatically for custom deployment scenarios
# Provides full control over server lifecycle and configuration within Python applications
import asyncio
from jesse_framework_mcp import main

# Execute server with custom async context and error handling
async def run_jesse_server():
    try:
        await main()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Server error: {e}")

# Run server with asyncio event loop management
asyncio.run(run_jesse_server())
```
