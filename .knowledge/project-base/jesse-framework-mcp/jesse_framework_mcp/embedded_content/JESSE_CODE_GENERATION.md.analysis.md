#### Functional Intent & Features

This file serves as the consolidated code generation standards document for the Jesse Framework MCP project, establishing unified rules for code creation, implementation approaches, and execution standards across all development activities. The system provides comprehensive governance for code generation operations through mandatory `KISS` (Keep It Simple & Stupid) principles, defensive programming error handling, and strict compliance enforcement mechanisms. Key semantic entities include `KISS approach` implementation requirements, `defensive programming` philosophy with throw-on-error behavior, `DRY principle` enforcement for code and documentation, `zero-tolerance policy` compliance mechanisms, `venv/` virtual environment activation requirements, `/jesse_wip_task_commit.md` workflow integration for Git operations, `JESSE_CODE_COMMENTS.md` file header standards, `JESSE_MARKDOWN.md` lifecycle management rules, `mermaid` diagram usage for visual communication, `source venv/bin/activate &&` command prefixing patterns, bug fix claim validation requirements with test execution proof, and comprehensive documentation-code alignment verification preventing contradictions between implementation and established project documentation. The document establishes authoritative standards for all code generation activities while ensuring consistency, maintainability, and alignment with project vision across the entire development ecosystem.

##### Main Components

The document contains twelve primary sections establishing comprehensive code generation governance: Critical Foundation Rules defining non-negotiable standards and universal application policies, KISS Approach specifying simplicity principles and implementation guidelines, Error Handling Strategy establishing defensive programming philosophy with throw-on-error requirements, DRY Principle Implementation covering code and documentation duplication prevention, Consistency Protection ensuring documentation-code alignment verification, File Modification Rules detailing header comment requirements and processing constraints, Command Execution Standards specifying virtual environment activation protocols, Communication Guidelines covering code presentation and visual diagram usage, Implementation Workflow defining pre-implementation checks and post-implementation verification, Enforcement and Compliance establishing zero-tolerance policies and verification processes, Git Commit Workflow Trigger specifying automatic workflow execution for commit requests, and Bug Fix Claim Standards requiring test execution proof for fix validation. Each section provides specific requirements, examples, and implementation guidance ensuring consistent application across all code generation operations.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements a comprehensive code generation governance model with mandatory compliance patterns, defensive programming principles, and strict separation between implementation and documentation consistency. The design employs KISS methodology enforcement preventing unnecessary feature additions, zero-tolerance error handling requiring immediate failure on error conditions, and DRY principle application across both code and documentation domains. The system uses documentation-code alignment verification preventing contradictions, virtual environment activation protocols ensuring consistent execution environments, and workflow integration patterns connecting code generation with Git operations. The architectural pattern includes multi-stage verification processes covering pre-implementation checks, during-implementation monitoring, and post-implementation validation while maintaining strict compliance with established project standards and preventing technical debt accumulation.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses systematic simplicity evaluation ensuring KISS principle adherence through explicit user requirement matching without feature expansion, defensive error handling implementation requiring throw-on-error behavior with descriptive error messages, and comprehensive DRY violation detection across code and documentation. The approach employs documentation consistency checking with immediate implementation halting when contradictions are detected, virtual environment activation verification through `venv/` directory detection and command prefixing, and workflow integration triggering `/jesse_wip_task_commit.md` execution for Git commit requests. Quality assurance uses zero-tolerance compliance verification, immediate correction requirements for standard violations, and comprehensive validation protocols ensuring ongoing adherence to established standards while preventing code generation debt accumulation through rushed implementations.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The document addresses compliance violations through zero-tolerance enforcement requiring immediate correction of missing error handling, documentation misalignment, and DRY principle violations. Documentation-code contradiction scenarios trigger immediate implementation halting with explicit option presentation for alignment resolution. Virtual environment detection failures provide clear command transformation requirements ensuring consistent execution environments. Bug fix claim validation prevents unsubstantiated fix assertions requiring concrete test execution proof before claiming resolution. The system handles complex file modifications through logical sequence processing with maximum 5 operations for files exceeding 500 lines. Git commit request detection covers multiple phrase variations ensuring comprehensive workflow trigger coverage while maintaining mandatory user confirmation requirements.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The KISS principle enforcement uses systematic requirement matching preventing feature expansion beyond explicit user requests with proactive complexity highlighting. Error handling implementation requires throw-on-error behavior with descriptive error message construction specifying exact component failures and precise failure reasons. DRY principle application uses duplicate logic identification with common functionality extraction and pattern recognition across code and documentation domains. Documentation consistency verification implements immediate contradiction detection with exact quote presentation and explicit resolution option provision. Virtual environment activation uses directory existence checking with command prefixing patterns ensuring consistent execution environments. Bug fix validation requires test execution proof with observable results and reproducibility verification before allowing fix claims.

########### Code Usage Examples

This example demonstrates the mandatory virtual environment activation pattern for command execution when the environment exists:

```bash
# Virtual environment activation requirement for all shell commands
source venv/bin/activate && pip install requests
# Ensures consistent execution environment and proper dependency management
```

This example shows the defensive programming error handling approach with throw-on-error behavior and descriptive messaging:

```python
# Defensive programming implementation with immediate failure on error conditions
def process_data(input_data):
    if not input_data:
        raise ValueError("DataProcessor: Input data is None or empty - cannot process invalid input")
    # Process data with explicit error propagation rather than silent failure handling
```

This example illustrates the documentation-code alignment verification process when contradictions are detected:

```markdown
# Documentation contradiction resolution with explicit option presentation
Documentation states: "All API endpoints must use POST method for data submission"

OPTION 1 - ALIGN WITH DOCS: Implement POST endpoint following documentation requirements
OPTION 2 - UPDATE DOCS: Change documentation to reflect GET endpoint implementation
# Immediate implementation halt until user provides explicit resolution choice
```
