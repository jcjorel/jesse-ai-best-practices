######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The module addresses missing rule files through `FileNotFoundError` exceptions with descriptive messages indicating the specific file path that could not be found. Workflow file access handles missing `.md` extensions through automatic extension appending while preserving existing extensions when provided. Non-existent workflows directory scenarios return empty lists from `list_workflows()` rather than raising exceptions, enabling graceful degradation when workflow content is unavailable. File encoding issues are mitigated through explicit `utf-8` encoding specification in all `read_text()` operations. The system handles invalid rule names by raising `FileNotFoundError` when the constructed file path does not exist, providing clear feedback about missing content. Path resolution failures are prevented through module-relative path construction using `__file__.parent` ensuring consistent embedded content location regardless of execution context.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The `EMBEDDED_CONTENT_DIR` constant uses `Path(__file__).parent` for module-relative path resolution ensuring embedded content accessibility from the package installation location. Rule content retrieval constructs file paths using f-string formatting with `JESSE_{rule_name.upper()}.md` pattern and validates existence before reading. Workflow content access implements conditional extension appending using `endswith('.md')` checking and path construction through directory joining. File enumeration uses `glob()` patterns with specific filtering: `JESSE_*.md` for rules and `*.md` for workflows. Rule name normalization employs `stem.replace("JESSE_", "").lower()` for filename to identifier conversion. Content aggregation combines individual retrieval functions with dictionary comprehension, handling both rule and workflow content types. Error handling uses consistent `FileNotFoundError` raising with formatted error messages including the attempted file path for debugging purposes.

########### Code Usage Examples

This example demonstrates basic rule content retrieval using the module's primary access function. The function handles rule name normalization and provides clear error messages for missing content.

```python
# Retrieve specific JESSE rule content by name
from jesse_framework_mcp.embedded_content import get_jesse_rule_content

rule_content = get_jesse_rule_content('knowledge_management')
# Returns content of JESSE_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT.md file
```

This example shows workflow content access with automatic extension handling. The function accepts workflow names with or without the `.md` extension for flexible usage patterns.

```python
# Access workflow content with flexible naming
from jesse_framework_mcp.embedded_content import get_workflow_content

workflow_content = get_workflow_content('jesse_wip_task_create')
# Automatically appends .md extension and retrieves workflow content
```

This example illustrates comprehensive content enumeration and bulk access capabilities. The functions provide complete visibility into available embedded content for framework introspection.

```python
# Enumerate and access all embedded content
from jesse_framework_mcp.embedded_content import list_jesse_rules, list_workflows, get_all_embedded_files

########### Code Usage Examples

This example demonstrates the mandatory virtual environment activation pattern for command execution when the environment exists:

```bash
# Virtual environment activation requirement for all shell commands
source venv/bin/activate && pip install requests
# Ensures consistent execution environment and proper dependency management
```

This example shows the defensive programming error handling approach with throw-on-error behavior and descriptive messaging:

```python
# Defensive programming implementation with immediate failure on error conditions
def process_data(input_data):
    if not input_data:
        raise ValueError("DataProcessor: Input data is None or empty - cannot process invalid input")
    # Process data with explicit error propagation rather than silent failure handling
```

This example illustrates the documentation-code alignment verification process when contradictions are detected:

```markdown
# Documentation contradiction resolution with explicit option presentation
Documentation states: "All API endpoints must use POST method for data submission"

OPTION 1 - ALIGN WITH DOCS: Implement POST endpoint following documentation requirements
OPTION 2 - UPDATE DOCS: Change documentation to reflect GET endpoint implementation
# Immediate implementation halt until user provides explicit resolution choice
```

- **Ecosystem Position**: Auxiliary infrastructure component supporting complex development workflows through structured planning capabilities while explicitly preventing authoritative reference usage in production systems
- **Integration Pattern**: Created by development workflows for complex task planning, consumed by implementation processes for structured execution guidance, and managed through lifecycle protocols while maintaining absolute prohibition against production code or documentation references

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The document addresses compliance violations through zero-tolerance enforcement requiring immediate correction of missing required files, incorrect naming patterns, and inconsistent status indicators. Reference prohibition violations trigger absolute blocking with no exceptions permitted for scratchpad content appearing in production code or documentation dependencies. Complexity criteria edge cases receive explicit guidance for borderline tasks with clear thresholds and evaluation criteria. Context window exhaustion scenarios implement graceful halting at 80% capacity with proper progress preservation and session handoff procedures. The system handles incomplete plan creation through structured recovery processes, maintains consistency checking requirements across fresh sessions, and provides specific violation categories with corresponding resolution procedures ensuring adherence to established standards.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The directory structure system uses `lower_snake_case` pattern matching for implementation plan names with mandatory subdirectory creation under `<project_root>/scratchpad/` location. File naming conventions implement exact patterns including `plan_overview.md`, `plan_progress.md`, `plan_{subtask_name}.md`, and `doc_update.md` with specific content requirements for each file type. Status tracking uses precise symbol definitions (`❌`, `🔄`, `✅`, `🚧`, `✨`) with mandatory maintenance throughout implementation phases. Compliance verification implements multi-stage checking including creation validation, progress monitoring, completion confirmation, and periodic audit cycles. Reference prohibition enforcement maintains absolute exclusion lists preventing scratchpad content from appearing in production systems while ensuring clear separation between temporary planning materials and authoritative project documentation.

########### Code Usage Examples

This example demonstrates the mandatory directory structure pattern for complex implementation planning. The structured approach ensures consistent workspace organization across all temporary planning activities.

```bash
# Create scratchpad directory following mandatory pattern structure
mkdir -p scratchpad/authentication_system_implementation/
# Directory name uses lower_snake_case format as required
```

This example shows the required file structure within scratchpad directories with mandatory file types. The standardized naming patterns enable consistent organization and automated processing of planning documents.

```markdown
# Standard scratchpad file organization with required naming conventions
scratchpad/authentication_system_implementation/plan_overview.md
scratchpad/authentication_system_implementation/plan_progress.md
scratchpad/authentication_system_implementation/plan_database_schema.md
scratchpad/authentication_system_implementation/plan_api_endpoints.md
scratchpad/authentication_system_implementation/doc_update.md
```

This example illustrates the mandatory progress tracking format with specific status symbols. The standardized tracking system enables consistent monitoring and reporting across all implementation planning activities.

```markdown
# Progress tracking format using required status symbols
## Implementation Progress Status
- Database Schema Plan: ✅ Plan created
- API Endpoints Plan: 🔄 In progress  
- Authentication Logic Plan: ❌ Plan not created
- Integration Testing Plan: 🚧 Implementation in progress
- Documentation Updates: ✨ Completed
```
