#### Functional Intent & Features

This workflow documentation provides a comprehensive knowledge consistency verification system for the Jesse Framework MCP project, designed to identify and resolve contradictions across distributed knowledge management files to maintain single source of truth principles. The system delivers systematic scanning capabilities across multiple knowledge bases including `.clinerules/JESSE_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT.md`, `.knowledge/persistent-knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`, `WIP_TASK.md` files, and git clone knowledge bases, conflict detection and categorization with severity levels (`Critical`, `Major`, `Minor`, `Informational`), and resolution implementation with user-guided decision making. Key semantic entities include `Essential Knowledge Base` scanning, `Persistent Knowledge Base` analysis, `Active WIP Task Knowledge` extraction, `Git Clone Knowledge Bases` processing, `Terminology Consistency` verification, `Factual Consistency` validation, `Reference Consistency` checking, `Intemporal Writing Verification`, `Cross-Reference Validation`, `Duplicate Detection`, automated consistency rules, and comprehensive reporting mechanisms enabling systematic knowledge base maintenance and quality assurance across the entire Jesse Framework MCP ecosystem.

##### Main Components

The workflow contains eleven sequential execution steps forming the core consistency verification process, five consistency check categories for systematic analysis, automated consistency rules for validation, and comprehensive error handling mechanisms. Primary execution components include knowledge base scanning procedures (Essential, Persistent, WIP Task, Git Clone), conflict identification and severity categorization systems, user-guided resolution decision gathering, implementation procedures with file modification capabilities, and verification processes ensuring successful resolution. The workflow incorporates specialized consistency check categories covering terminology alignment, factual verification, and reference validation, supported by automated rules for intemporal writing standards, cross-reference validation, and duplicate content detection.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements a sequential workflow pattern with systematic knowledge base traversal, conflict detection algorithms, and user-interactive resolution processes. The design employs a multi-source scanning approach that processes different knowledge repositories independently before cross-referencing for consistency analysis. The system uses severity-based conflict categorization enabling prioritized resolution workflows, with user-guided decision making for each identified inconsistency. The architectural pattern includes comprehensive verification loops ensuring resolution success and preventing introduction of new conflicts during the consistency enforcement process. The design incorporates automated rule engines for standard consistency checks while maintaining human oversight for complex resolution decisions.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses systematic file scanning with content extraction and comparison algorithms to identify knowledge inconsistencies across multiple sources. The approach employs pattern matching for terminology consistency, factual statement comparison for contradiction detection, and reference validation for link integrity verification. The system implements user interaction patterns for resolution decision gathering, with structured options for updating sources, creating standards, consolidating information, or adding cross-references. File modification procedures maintain intemporal writing standards while preserving essential context and meaning. The implementation includes comprehensive reporting mechanisms with detailed conflict analysis, resolution tracking, and preventive recommendations for future consistency maintenance.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The workflow handles missing or corrupted knowledge base files by continuing with available sources and noting issues in the comprehensive report. Resolution implementation failures preserve original content and log errors to prevent data loss during consistency enforcement. Cross-reference validation failures mark potentially broken references without interrupting the overall consistency check process. The system provides rollback options if consistency check procedures introduce new problems or conflicts. Error handling includes scenarios where automated consistency rules conflict with manual resolution decisions, requiring user intervention to establish precedence. The workflow addresses cases where circular references exist between knowledge sources, implementing detection mechanisms to prevent infinite loops during consistency verification.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The workflow uses content extraction algorithms that parse markdown files and identify knowledge entries, terminology definitions, and factual statements for comparison analysis. Conflict detection employs string matching, semantic analysis, and reference validation to identify inconsistencies across multiple knowledge sources. Resolution implementation uses file modification procedures that maintain markdown formatting while updating content according to user decisions. The system implements timestamp management for modified files and maintains audit trails of all changes made during consistency enforcement. Internal mechanisms include backup creation before modifications, validation of changes against consistency rules, and verification that cross-references remain valid after content updates.

########### Code Usage Examples

This example demonstrates the systematic knowledge base scanning process that forms the foundation of the consistency check workflow:

```markdown
# Execute comprehensive knowledge base scan across all sources
1. Read .clinerules/JESSE_KNOWLEDGE_MANAGEMENT.md for essential knowledge
2. Process .knowledge/persistent-knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md for patterns
3. Analyze active WIP_TASK.md for current discoveries
4. Scan all git clone knowledge bases for integration details
5. Extract terminology, facts, and references from each source
```

This example shows the conflict identification and categorization process used to prioritize resolution efforts:

```markdown
# Identify and categorize knowledge conflicts by severity
- Critical: API endpoint contradictions between sources
- Major: Terminology inconsistencies for same concepts
- Minor: Formatting differences in similar content
- Informational: Duplicate information requiring consolidation
```

This example illustrates the user-guided resolution process that ensures appropriate handling of each identified conflict:

```markdown
# Present conflicts with resolution options for user decision
Conflict: Authentication method described as "OAuth2" in Essential KB, "API Key" in Persistent KB
Options:
- Update Essential KB to match Persistent KB
- Update Persistent KB to match Essential KB  
- Create new standard terminology across both sources
- Add cross-reference linking both authentication methods
```
