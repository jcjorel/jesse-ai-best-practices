#### Functional Intent & Features

This file defines the comprehensive `Capture Our Chat Workflow` for preserving complete conversation records between users and assistants within the Jesse Framework ecosystem, providing permanent markdown documentation of interactive sessions including code changes, task completions, and all conversational exchanges. The workflow delivers systematic conversation archival through trigger-based activation, structured content formatting, and timestamped file generation with write-only access patterns. Key semantic entities include the `capture our chat` trigger phrase, `.coding_assistant/captured_chats/` directory structure, `YYYYMMDD-HHmm` timestamp format specification, `snake_case` topic conversion algorithm, `YAML` code block formatting for user messages, markdown preservation for assistant responses, file path construction pattern `<project_root>/.coding_assistant/captured_chats/YYYYMMDD-HHmm-<Chat_topic_in_snake_case>.md`, structured file headers with date and topic metadata, conversation body chronological ordering, file footer with task completion results, recreation handling with progressive snapshots, and integration references to `JESSE_MARKDOWN.md` standards for file management and naming conventions. The system enables developers to maintain comprehensive conversation archives while ensuring ephemeral document handling and preventing context pollution through read-back restrictions.

##### Main Components

The workflow contains seven primary operational steps: chat topic identification through conversation analysis and `snake_case` conversion, timestamp generation using `YYYYMMDD-HHmm` format specification, file path construction with standardized directory structure, conversation content formatting with `YAML` blocks for user messages and markdown preservation for assistant responses, structured content organization including file headers with metadata and chronological conversation bodies, recreation handling with progressive snapshot creation for multiple captures, and confirmation response with file location and conversation metrics. Supporting components include implementation guidelines for file system operations and content completeness requirements, special considerations for ephemeral document handling and read-back restrictions, comprehensive error handling procedures for file writing failures, and example usage patterns demonstrating simple captures, contextual captures, and multiple capture scenarios.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements a trigger-response workflow pattern with structured content preservation and write-only file access constraints. The design uses natural language trigger detection for workflow activation, systematic topic extraction and standardization through `snake_case` conversion, and hierarchical file organization under `.coding_assistant/captured_chats/` directory structure. The system employs template-based content formatting with distinct `YAML` blocks for user messages, standard markdown for assistant responses, and structured file organization with headers, conversation bodies, and completion footers. The workflow follows a progressive snapshot pattern enabling multiple captures within single conversations while preventing file overwrites through timestamp-based naming. The architecture includes ephemeral document handling with explicit read-back restrictions and comprehensive error handling for file system operations.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses natural language trigger detection for `capture our chat` phrase recognition, automated topic extraction through conversation analysis with fallback to primary task identification, and standardized file naming through timestamp generation and `snake_case` topic conversion. The approach employs structured content formatting with `YAML` code blocks for user message highlighting, markdown preservation for assistant responses with syntax highlighting maintenance, and chronological conversation ordering with complete context preservation. File system operations implement directory creation with permission handling, atomic file writing with error recovery, and progressive snapshot management for multiple captures. The system uses template-driven content structure with standardized headers, conversation bodies, and completion footers while maintaining write-only access patterns and ephemeral document classification.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The workflow handles file writing failures through immediate user notification and alternative content display for manual saving when automated file creation fails. Directory creation issues are managed through permission validation and graceful error reporting with fallback instructions for manual directory setup. Multiple capture requests within single conversations trigger progressive snapshot creation with timestamp-based naming to prevent file overwrites while preserving conversation evolution. Topic extraction failures default to generic naming patterns with timestamp-based identification when conversation themes cannot be determined. File system permission errors provide clear guidance for access configuration and alternative storage locations. Network or system interruptions during capture operations implement recovery mechanisms with partial content preservation and retry capabilities for complete conversation archival.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The topic extraction algorithm analyzes initial user requests and conversation themes using keyword identification and context analysis with fallback to primary task or feature discussion topics. Timestamp generation uses system time at capture request moment with precise `YYYYMMDD-HHmm` format compliance and timezone handling for consistency. File path construction combines project root detection, standardized directory structure, timestamp formatting, and `snake_case` topic conversion with conflict resolution for existing files. Content formatting implements `YAML` code block wrapping for user messages, markdown preservation for assistant responses with syntax highlighting maintenance, and chronological ordering with complete context inclusion. File structure generation uses template processing with dynamic header insertion, conversation body assembly, and standardized footer completion with task result documentation. Recreation handling implements timestamp comparison and progressive file creation with unique naming to prevent overwrites while maintaining conversation continuity.

########### Code Usage Examples

This example demonstrates the basic workflow trigger and file path construction pattern. The standardized approach ensures consistent conversation archival with proper directory organization and timestamp-based naming.

```markdown
User: "Please capture our chat"
Assistant: ‚úÖ Chat captured successfully!
üìÑ File: <project_root>/.coding_assistant/captured_chats/20250624-1430-feature_development.md
üìù Topic: Feature Development Discussion
üíæ Size: Approximately 150 exchanges
```

This example shows the structured content formatting with YAML blocks for user messages and markdown preservation for assistant responses. The formatting ensures clear conversation distinction while maintaining code block integrity.

```yaml
User: We need to implement authentication for the new API endpoint
```

This example demonstrates assistant response formatting with embedded code blocks. The markdown structure preserves syntax highlighting while maintaining conversation flow and technical content integrity.

```markdown
I'll help you implement authentication for the API endpoint. Let's start by analyzing the current authentication system and then create the necessary middleware.
```

```python
def authenticate_request(request):
    token = request.headers.get('Authorization')
    if not token:
        raise AuthenticationError("Missing authorization token")
    return validate_token(token)
```

This example illustrates the progressive snapshot handling for multiple captures within single conversations. The timestamp-based naming prevents overwrites while preserving conversation evolution and enabling historical reference.

```markdown
# First capture at 14:30
File: 20250624-1430-authentication_implementation.md

# Second capture at 15:45 (same conversation)
File: 20250624-1545-authentication_implementation.md

# Both files preserved with complete conversation history up to capture point
```
