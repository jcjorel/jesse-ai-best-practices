#### Functional Intent & Features

This file defines the comprehensive `WIP Task Knowledge Capture Workflow` for systematically capturing and structuring knowledge from various sources within the Jesse Framework ecosystem, providing organized storage for both task-specific and persistent knowledge management. The workflow delivers structured knowledge capture through six knowledge type classifications, dual storage location management, and comprehensive information gathering protocols with `intemporal writing` format conversion. Key semantic entities include knowledge type categories (`Perplexity Query Result`, `Web Resource`, `Pattern/Solution`, `API Knowledge`, `Discovery`, `Tool/Resource`), storage location options (`WIP Task Specific`, `Persistent Knowledge`, `Both`), structured information templates for each knowledge type, `intemporal writing` guidelines requiring present tense factual statements, file update targets including `WIP_TASK.md` and `.knowledge/persistent-knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`, knowledge consistency verification protocols, timestamp update requirements for `Last Updated` fields, automatic capture triggers (`remember this`, `capture this knowledge`, `save this information`, `document this finding`), and integration with `Perplexity MCP server` for query result processing. The system enables developers to maintain comprehensive knowledge repositories while ensuring consistency, accessibility, and structured organization across both immediate task context and long-term project knowledge bases.

##### Main Components

The workflow contains seven primary execution steps: knowledge type identification with six distinct categories for different information sources, storage location determination supporting task-specific and persistent knowledge options, structured information gathering with specialized templates for each knowledge type, intemporal writing format conversion ensuring present tense factual representation, appropriate file updates targeting `WIP_TASK.md` and `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`, knowledge consistency verification preventing contradictions, and timestamp update maintenance for modified files. Supporting components include knowledge quality standards specifying intemporal writing guidelines and completeness criteria, workflow completion verification procedures, comprehensive error handling for conflicts and failures, and automatic capture trigger recognition for natural language activation phrases enabling seamless knowledge capture integration into development workflows.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements a dual-storage knowledge management pattern with structured categorization and format standardization across both task-specific and persistent knowledge repositories. The design uses knowledge type classification for appropriate template selection, storage location determination based on knowledge scope and applicability, and structured information gathering through specialized templates ensuring comprehensive capture. The system employs intemporal writing conversion for consistent knowledge representation, dual-target file update mechanisms supporting both immediate task context and long-term knowledge persistence, and consistency verification protocols maintaining single source of truth principles. The workflow follows an automatic trigger activation pattern enabling natural language knowledge capture integration while maintaining structured organization and format compliance.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses knowledge type classification algorithms for appropriate template selection and information gathering, structured template processing for comprehensive knowledge capture across six distinct categories, and intemporal writing conversion ensuring present tense factual representation throughout all captured content. The approach employs dual-storage management with conditional file updates based on knowledge scope determination, consistency verification through comparison with existing entries and terminology validation, and timestamp maintenance for accurate change tracking. File update operations target specific sections within `WIP_TASK.md` including `Key Discoveries`, `Patterns Identified`, `Challenges & Solutions`, and `Task Resources`, while persistent knowledge updates target categorized sections in `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` including `Perplexity Query Results`, `Web Resources`, `Patterns and Solutions`, and `External APIs`.

**← Referenced By:**
- Development workflows - consume captured knowledge for informed decision-making and implementation guidance
- Task management processes - reference structured knowledge for progress tracking and context maintenance
- Knowledge management workflows - use captured information for consistency verification and cross-referencing
- Future development sessions - access persistent knowledge for continued project understanding and implementation patterns

**⚡ System role and ecosystem integration:**
- **System Role**: Core knowledge capture workflow within the Jesse Framework knowledge management ecosystem, serving as the primary mechanism for structured information preservation and organization
- **Ecosystem Position**: Central knowledge acquisition component bridging external information sources with internal knowledge repositories through structured capture and format standardization
- **Integration Pattern**: Triggered automatically through natural language phrases or manually invoked, consumes external information sources and research results, produces structured knowledge entries in both task-specific and persistent storage locations

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The workflow handles knowledge conflicts with existing entries through user prompt resolution and dual-source updating to maintain consistency. File update failures preserve knowledge in temporary locations with rollback options and retry mechanisms for successful capture completion. Incomplete formatting scenarios prompt for missing information with validation requirements before knowledge storage. Storage location conflicts between task-specific and persistent knowledge trigger user guidance for appropriate categorization and potential dual storage. Network connectivity issues affecting external resource access implement graceful degradation with offline knowledge processing capabilities. Timestamp update failures provide alternative tracking mechanisms while preserving knowledge capture integrity and maintaining change history accuracy.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The knowledge type identification mechanism uses pattern matching and user prompt processing for appropriate template selection and information gathering structure. Structured information templates implement field validation and completeness checking for each knowledge category with specific requirements for URLs, contexts, applications, and implementation details. Intemporal writing conversion uses text processing algorithms for present tense conversion, factual statement restructuring, and terminology consistency validation. File update operations implement section-specific insertion with proper markdown formatting and existing content preservation. Consistency verification uses content comparison algorithms with terminology matching and conflict detection across multiple knowledge sources. Timestamp management implements ISO format generation with file modification tracking and change history maintenance for accurate knowledge evolution documentation.
