#### Functional Intent & Features

This workflow specification defines a comprehensive PDF import and indexing system for the Jesse Framework's knowledge base, utilizing LLM-based visual understanding to create searchable, chunked PDF repositories. The functional intent centers on providing developers with a robust, resumable PDF processing pipeline that eliminates external OCR dependencies while maintaining precise page-to-chunk mapping for accurate content retrieval. Key semantic entities include `PyPDF2` for PDF manipulation, `.knowledge/pdf-knowledge/` directory structure for organized storage, `import_progress.json` for session state management, `PdfReader` and `PdfWriter` classes for chunking operations, `snake_case` filename sanitization, and mandatory page reference enforcement with `(chunk: filename.pdf)` notation. The workflow provides automatic WIP task disabling, multi-session resumability, context window monitoring, and comprehensive error handling to ensure reliable processing of large PDF documents across multiple Cline sessions.

##### Main Components

The workflow contains eleven primary execution steps: Check for Existing Import Session, Gather PDF Information, Validate PDF File, Initialize Import Session, Generate Directory Structure, Copy Original PDF, Execute PDF Chunking, Initialize or Load Knowledge Base File, Process Chunks with LLM, Generate Cross-References, and Finalize Import. Additional components include Session Initialization Override for WIP task disabling, Session Handoff Protocol for context window management, Multi-Session Coordination for state persistence, and comprehensive Error Handling for resumable and critical failures. The workflow integrates an embedded Python chunking script with resumable capabilities and enforces strict page reference compliance throughout the knowledge base creation process.

###### Architecture & Design

The architectural design implements a multi-session, resumable processing pattern with fail-safe state management and atomic progress tracking. The workflow separates concerns between PDF chunking operations, LLM-based content analysis, and knowledge base construction, enabling independent recovery from failures at each stage. The design utilizes file-based state persistence through `import_progress.json` and incremental knowledge base updates, ensuring no in-memory dependencies between sessions. Session handoff mechanisms monitor context window usage and provide clean transition points, while the page reference enforcement system maintains precise chunk-to-content mapping throughout the entire process.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation strategy combines Python-based PDF processing with LLM vision analysis in a resumable pipeline architecture. The embedded Python script utilizes `PyPDF2` for chunk creation with automatic resume detection through existing file enumeration, while progress tracking employs JSON-based state files with timestamp management. Content analysis follows a chunk-by-chunk approach with context window monitoring, implementing automatic session handoff when usage exceeds 80%. The page reference enforcement mechanism requires immediate chunk filename annotation for every page number mention, ensuring precise content retrieval through standardized `(chunk: filename.pdf)` notation.

- **Ecosystem Position**: Core component bridging external PDF documents with searchable knowledge base infrastructure, enabling document-aware development workflows
- **Integration Pattern**: Invoked by developers through workflow commands with dependencies on Python runtime, file system access, and LLM vision capabilities for comprehensive PDF processing and indexing

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The workflow addresses multiple critical error scenarios including context window limit handling with automatic session handoff and progress preservation, chunk read failures with skip-and-continue logic, temporary LLM errors with retry mechanisms up to three attempts, and PDF corruption detection with partial import preservation. Critical error handling covers disk space issues with pause-and-intervention protocols, invalid PDF structure reporting with attempted partial imports, and file integrity validation using SHA256 hash verification. The resumable error system maintains state consistency through atomic progress updates, while multi-session coordination handles interrupted processing through comprehensive state restoration and validation mechanisms.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The internal implementation relies on file-based state management through JSON progress tracking with automatic timestamp updates, directory traversal algorithms for existing chunk detection and resume capability, and atomic file operations for chunk creation with integrity verification. The workflow maintains internal chunk mapping tables correlating page ranges with generated filenames, implements context window usage monitoring with percentage-based thresholds, and utilizes structured error reporting with specific resolution guidance. Session coordination employs state file locking mechanisms, progress validation through file existence checks, and comprehensive logging for debugging and maintenance operations across multiple processing sessions.

########### Code Usage Examples

The following examples demonstrate key workflow operations and integration patterns. PDF chunking script execution with resumable capability:

```python
# Embedded Python script for resumable PDF chunking
chunks, progress = chunk_pdf_resumable(input_pdf, output_dir)
print(f"Chunking complete: {len(chunks)} total chunks")
```

Progress tracking structure for multi-session coordination:

```json
{
  "pdf_path": "/path/to/original.pdf",
  "snake_case_name": "technical_manual",
  "total_pages": 1000,
  "chunks_processed": 25,
  "chunks_analyzed": 20,
  "status": "analyzing"
}
```

Page reference enforcement with mandatory chunk filename notation:

```markdown
# Knowledge base content with enforced chunk references
The authentication process on page 45 (chunk: manual_pages_041_060.pdf) describes the security protocols, while configuration details on pages 156-162 (chunks: manual_pages_141_160.pdf, manual_pages_161_180.pdf) provide implementation guidance.
