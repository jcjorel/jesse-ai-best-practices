#### Functional Intent & Features

This workflow documentation provides a comprehensive framework upgrade system for the JESSE AI Best Practices Framework, designed to safely update framework installations while preserving user data and maintaining operational continuity. The system delivers temporary `WIP task loading` disablement for clean upgrade environments, automated framework installation execution through the documented `README.md` process, and session-scoped context management preventing upgrade interference. Key semantic entities include `WIP task auto-loading` session flag management, `${HOME}/Cline/Rules/` global installation paths, `.clinerules/` project-level installation directories, `JESSE_*.md` framework file updates, `https://github.com/jcjorel/jesse-ai-best-practices` repository integration, `/jesse_wip_task_new_session.md` post-upgrade initialization, `/jesse_framework_upgrade.md` workflow invocation, `AI-guided installation process` execution, `knowledge management system` preservation, and comprehensive upgrade verification procedures ensuring framework functionality and data integrity across both global and project-level installations.

##### Main Components

The workflow contains five sequential steps forming the complete upgrade process: WIP task loading disablement, user confirmation procedures, framework upgrade execution, upgrade verification protocols, and session restart recommendations. Primary components include session-only flag creation for WIP task context isolation, user confirmation dialogs with explicit upgrade intentions, automated installation command execution referencing the official GitHub repository, post-installation verification checks covering framework files and functionality, and comprehensive user guidance for session restoration. The workflow incorporates implementation notes covering upgrade safety principles, installation process integration details, context management strategies, and post-upgrade behavior specifications.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements a non-destructive upgrade pattern with session-scoped context isolation and incremental framework updates. The design employs temporary WIP task disablement to prevent context confusion during upgrade operations, while maintaining all persistent data structures including knowledge bases, task histories, and user configurations. The system uses the documented AI-guided installation process as the core upgrade mechanism, leveraging existing framework installation procedures for consistency and reliability. The architectural pattern includes comprehensive verification loops ensuring successful upgrade completion and proper framework functionality restoration.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses session-scoped flag management to temporarily disable WIP task auto-loading without modifying persistent configuration files. The approach employs direct execution of the documented installation command from the framework README, triggering the AI-guided installation process that handles both global and project-level installations appropriately. The system implements comprehensive verification procedures checking framework file updates, workflow accessibility, knowledge management system functionality, and basic framework operations. Post-upgrade procedures include explicit user guidance for session restart and WIP task context restoration through complementary workflows.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The workflow handles upgrade failures by providing specific error guidance and retry mechanisms without permanent changes to user configurations. Installation process failures preserve all user data and allow multiple upgrade attempts without data loss or configuration corruption. Missing or inaccessible framework repository scenarios provide fallback guidance and alternative installation approaches. The system addresses scenarios where WIP task context conflicts with upgrade operations by maintaining session-scoped isolation without affecting persistent task data. Error handling includes verification failures where framework files are not properly updated, requiring manual intervention or alternative installation methods. The workflow manages cases where user customizations conflict with framework updates, preserving user modifications while updating core framework components.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The workflow uses session-scoped flag mechanisms that create temporary variables preventing WIP task auto-loading without modifying persistent configuration files or user data structures. Upgrade execution leverages the documented AI-guided installation process from the framework README, ensuring consistency with official installation procedures and handling both global and project-level installation scenarios. Verification procedures implement comprehensive checks across framework files, workflow accessibility, knowledge management system functionality, and basic framework operations to ensure successful upgrade completion. Post-upgrade guidance includes specific instructions for session restart and WIP task context restoration, maintaining operational continuity while ensuring framework updates are properly integrated.

########### Code Usage Examples

This example demonstrates the basic framework upgrade invocation that initiates the complete upgrade process with user confirmation:

```bash
# Execute framework upgrade workflow with automatic WIP task isolation
User: /jesse_framework_upgrade.md
# System disables WIP task loading, confirms upgrade intention, executes installation
```

This example shows the complete upgrade cycle including post-upgrade session restoration for full operational continuity:

```bash
# Complete framework upgrade with session restoration workflow
User: /jesse_framework_upgrade.md
# AI confirms upgrade, disables WIP, executes installation from GitHub repository
# User starts new session after upgrade completion
User: /jesse_wip_task_new_session.md
# System restores WIP task context and verifies framework functionality
```

This example illustrates troubleshooting upgrade scenarios with retry mechanisms and error handling:

```bash
# Handle upgrade failures with retry and error resolution
User: /jesse_framework_upgrade.md
# AI attempts upgrade, encounters installation error, provides specific guidance
# User addresses specific issues (network, permissions, repository access)
User: /jesse_framework_upgrade.md
# System retries upgrade with resolved conditions
```
