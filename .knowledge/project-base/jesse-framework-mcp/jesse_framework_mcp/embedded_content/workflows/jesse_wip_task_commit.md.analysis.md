#### Functional Intent & Features

This file defines the comprehensive `WIP Task Commit Workflow` for creating standards-compliant git commit messages with multi-line structured documentation, leveraging git diff analysis and file history data to ensure accuracy and completeness within the Jesse Framework ecosystem. The workflow delivers systematic commit message generation through seven execution steps including change analysis, context extraction, structured message preparation, validation, mandatory user confirmation, and commit creation. Key semantic entities include `git diff` command integration with flags (`--staged`, `--stat`, `--name-only`), structured commit message format with mandatory sections (`[Commit intent]`, `[Implementation details]`, `[Testing performed]`, `[Impact analysis]`, `[Related items]`), commit type definitions (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `perf`, `style`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`), scope requirements for component identification, 72-character subject line limit, `[GenAI tool change history]` section extraction from file headers, `[Function intent]` and `[Design principles]` documentation integration, `[BREAKING CHANGE]` section for API modifications, `/jesse_wip_task_disable.md` workflow integration for repository-wide changes, mandatory user confirmation step, 4-line limits for implementation and impact sections with major change exceptions, `.gitmessage` template configuration, and comprehensive validation requirements with zero-tolerance enforcement policies. The system enables developers to maintain high-quality version control documentation while ensuring consistency, traceability, and comprehensive change documentation across all repository modifications.

##### Main Components

The workflow contains seven primary execution steps: git diff analysis using multiple command variations for comprehensive change assessment, file history context extraction from headers and documentation sections, structured commit message preparation following mandatory format requirements, required section completion including commit intent, implementation details, testing performed, impact analysis, and related items, commit message validation with completeness and format verification, mandatory user confirmation step with explicit approval requirements, and commit creation using git command options. Supporting components include commit message structure standards with type definitions and scope requirements, content quality standards specifying technical detail requirements and line limits, validation and enforcement protocols with pre-commit checks, special commit type handling for breaking changes and emergency fixes, git diff integration guidelines for data extraction, file history leveraging procedures for context alignment, and tooling automation including templates, IDE integration, and helpful command references.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements a structured documentation-driven commit workflow with mandatory validation and user confirmation patterns. The design uses git diff integration for comprehensive change analysis, file history extraction for contextual alignment, and structured template processing for consistent message generation. The system employs mandatory section completion with specific content requirements, validation protocols ensuring completeness and format compliance, and user confirmation gates preventing automated commit execution. The workflow follows a quality-first approach with zero-tolerance enforcement policies, comprehensive validation requirements, and continuous improvement mechanisms. The architecture includes special handling for breaking changes, emergency fixes, and repository-wide modifications while maintaining integration with existing Jesse Framework workflows and documentation standards.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses git diff command integration with multiple flag combinations for comprehensive change analysis including unstaged changes, staged changes, file statistics, and modified file lists. The approach employs file header parsing for context extraction from `[GenAI tool change history]`, `[Function intent]`, and `[Design principles]` sections with dependency and constraint documentation. Structured message generation uses template processing with mandatory section completion, content validation, and format compliance checking. User confirmation implements explicit approval requirements with revision capabilities and blocking mechanisms preventing unauthorized commits. Validation protocols use automated checking for required sections, character limits, format compliance, and content quality standards with descriptive error reporting and correction guidance.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The workflow handles missing git diff data by requiring comprehensive change analysis before commit message creation with fallback to manual file inspection when automated analysis fails. Repository-wide changes without WIP task context trigger scope adjustment with broader change documentation requirements and context adaptation. Incomplete file header documentation receives graceful handling with alternative context sources and manual documentation requirements. User confirmation rejection triggers revision workflows with iterative improvement capabilities and blocking mechanisms preventing substandard commits. Validation failures provide specific error reporting with correction guidance and retry mechanisms for compliance achievement. Emergency fix scenarios maintain full documentation requirements with expedited validation processes and critical change handling protocols.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The git diff integration mechanism uses command flag combinations (`-P diff`, `--staged`, `--stat`, `--name-only`) for comprehensive change data extraction with context analysis and file modification tracking. File header parsing implements pattern matching for `[GenAI tool change history]`, `[Function intent]`, and `[Design principles]` sections with content extraction and context alignment verification. Structured message generation uses template processing with mandatory section completion, content validation, and format compliance checking including character limits and line restrictions. User confirmation implements explicit approval workflows with revision capabilities, blocking mechanisms, and quality gate enforcement. Validation protocols use automated checking with descriptive error reporting, correction guidance, and retry mechanisms for compliance achievement. Commit creation uses git command integration with proper formatting and multi-line message support.

########### Code Usage Examples

This example demonstrates comprehensive git diff analysis for change assessment and context gathering. The multi-command approach ensures complete understanding of modifications before commit message creation.

```bash
# Analyze all types of changes for comprehensive commit message preparation
git -P diff                    # View unstaged changes
git -P diff --staged          # View staged changes  
git -P diff --staged --stat   # Get file statistics
git -P diff --staged --name-only  # Get modified file list
```

This example shows the mandatory structured commit message format with all required sections. The template ensures comprehensive documentation with specific content requirements and validation compliance.

```bash
# Complete commit message structure following mandatory format requirements
feat(auth): Add OAuth2 token refresh with automatic retry logic

[Commit intent]
Users experienced authentication failures during long sessions when tokens
expired. This change implements automatic token refresh to maintain seamless
user experience without requiring re-authentication.

[Implementation details]
- Modified auth_manager.py to add token refresh logic with exponential backoff
- Implemented refresh queue in token_service.py for concurrent request handling
- Added token expiration monitoring with 5-minute early refresh
- Used asyncio.Lock() for thread-safe token refresh operations

[Testing performed]
- Unit tests: 15 new tests for token refresh scenarios
- Integration tests: Verified 100 concurrent requests during refresh
- Manual testing: Confirmed seamless experience during token expiration
- Performance testing: No degradation in normal authentication flow

[Impact analysis]
- Eliminates authentication interruptions for long-running sessions
- Adds ~10ms latency during token refresh operations
- No API changes required for existing clients
- Requires TOKEN_REFRESH_ENABLED=true configuration

[Related items]
- Issue: #456 (Token expiration authentication failures)
- Docs: Updated AUTH_API.md with refresh behavior documentation
```

This example illustrates the mandatory user confirmation step with explicit approval requirements. The confirmation process ensures quality control and prevents automated commit execution without human oversight.

```bash
# Mandatory user confirmation workflow preventing automated commits
echo "Please review this commit message. Do you approve this commit message and confirm that the commit can proceed? (Yes/No)"
read -r user_response
if [[ "$user_response" != "Yes" ]]; then
    echo "Commit cancelled. Please revise the commit message."
    exit 1
fi
git commit  # Proceed only after explicit user approval
```

This example demonstrates git diff integration for extracting specific implementation details and file statistics. The data extraction ensures accurate technical documentation in commit messages with concrete evidence of changes.

```bash
# Extract specific change data for accurate commit message documentation
git -P diff --staged --word-diff  # Get granular change details
git -P diff --staged path/to/specific/file.py  # Analyze specific file changes
git -P diff --staged --numstat   # Get numerical change statistics
# Use extracted data to populate [Implementation details] section accurately
```
