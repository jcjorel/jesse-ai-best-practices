#### Functional Intent & Features

This file serves as the consolidated code documentation standards document for the Jesse Framework MCP project, establishing mandatory three-section documentation patterns, file header templates, and comprehensive documentation lifecycle management across all code elements. The system provides universal documentation governance through non-negotiable three-section patterns for functions, methods, and classes, standardized file header templates with GenAI tool directives, and language-specific documentation templates ensuring consistency across Python, JavaScript, and Bash implementations. Key semantic entities include the mandatory three-section pattern (`[Function/Class method/Class intent]`, `[Design principles]`, `[Implementation details]`), comprehensive file header template with `GenAI coding tool directive` and `GenAI tool change history` sections, `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ` timestamp format requirements, zero-tolerance policy enforcement mechanisms, self-correction protocols for missing documentation, language-specific templates for `Python`, `JavaScript`, and `Bash` with appropriate docstring formats, dependency classification system using `<codebase|system|other>` prefixes, `scratchpad/` directory exclusion rules for dependencies, and comprehensive verification checklists ensuring documentation completeness, quality, and consistency across all code elements in the project.

##### Main Components

The document contains seven primary sections establishing comprehensive code documentation governance: Critical Foundation Rules defining the non-negotiable three-section pattern and universal application policy, File-Level Documentation Standards specifying mandatory header templates and change history management, Function/Method/Class Documentation Standards detailing the three-section pattern requirements and quality criteria, Language-Specific Templates providing Python, JavaScript, and Bash documentation formats, Documentation Quality & Verification establishing criteria and verification checklists, Documentation Lifecycle Management covering modification protocols and change history requirements, and Enforcement and Compliance defining zero-tolerance policies and compliance verification processes. Supporting components include self-correction mechanisms for missing documentation, header application rules for all non-markdown files, quality standards requiring technical justification for adjectives, and comprehensive verification checklists ensuring completeness across all documentation levels.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements a universal documentation governance model with mandatory three-section patterns applied to all code elements regardless of size or complexity. The design employs standardized file header templates with GenAI tool integration directives, comprehensive change history management with 4-entry limits, and language-specific documentation formats ensuring consistency across different programming languages. The system uses zero-tolerance enforcement mechanisms with immediate correction requirements, self-verification protocols preventing incomplete documentation, and lifecycle management integration maintaining documentation accuracy throughout code evolution. The architectural pattern includes dependency classification systems excluding scratchpad references, quality criteria requiring technical justification for claims, and comprehensive verification processes ensuring documentation completeness and consistency across all project code elements.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses mandatory three-section documentation patterns applied universally to functions, methods, and classes with specific section labels and content requirements. The approach employs standardized file header templates with GenAI tool directives, change history management using precise timestamp formats, and comprehensive dependency documentation with classification prefixes. Documentation quality enforcement uses verification checklists, self-correction mechanisms, and zero-tolerance policies preventing incomplete documentation. Language-specific implementation provides Python docstring templates, JavaScript JSDoc formats, and Bash comment structures with appropriate parameter and return documentation. Lifecycle management implements modification protocols updating file headers and maintaining documentation consistency throughout code evolution.

- **Ecosystem Position**: Core infrastructure component providing universal documentation requirements that govern all code creation, modification, and maintenance activities throughout the project
- **Integration Pattern**: Enforced by all development activities through zero-tolerance compliance policies, integrated with GenAI tools through header directives, coordinated with lifecycle management systems for documentation maintenance, and applied universally across all code elements regardless of complexity or programming language

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The system addresses missing documentation through immediate self-correction mechanisms requiring implementation halt until documentation is complete. Incomplete documentation scenarios trigger zero-tolerance enforcement with mandatory completion before proceeding with any development activities. File header update failures receive comprehensive verification protocols ensuring all sections remain accurate and consistent. Language-specific documentation format violations provide template-based correction guidance with appropriate docstring or comment structures. The system handles GenAI tool integration failures through header preservation directives and update requirement enforcement. Change history management edge cases maintain 4-entry limits with proper timestamp formatting and content accuracy verification ensuring documentation lifecycle integrity.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The three-section documentation pattern uses specific section labels with mandatory content requirements for intent, design principles, and implementation details. File header templates implement GenAI tool directives with change history management using precise timestamp formats and 4-entry rotation limits. Language-specific templates provide structured documentation formats with parameter, return value, and exception documentation appropriate for each programming language. Quality verification employs comprehensive checklists validating documentation completeness, technical justification requirements, and consistency across all documentation levels. Self-correction mechanisms implement immediate halt protocols when missing documentation is detected, requiring completion before resuming development activities. Dependency classification uses prefix systems excluding scratchpad directory references while maintaining comprehensive cross-reference documentation.

########### Code Usage Examples

This example demonstrates the mandatory file header template that must be applied to all non-markdown files in the project:

```bash
# File header template showing GenAI tool directives and comprehensive documentation structure
###############################################################################
# IMPORTANT: This header comment is designed for GenAI code review and maintenance
# Any GenAI tool working with this file MUST preserve and update this header
###############################################################################
# [GenAI coding tool directive]
# - Maintain this header with all modifications
# - Update History section with each change
# - Keep only the 4 most recent records in the history section. Sort from newer to older.
###############################################################################
```

This example shows the mandatory three-section documentation pattern for Python functions with complete docstring structure:

```python
# Python function template demonstrating the three-section pattern with comprehensive documentation
def function_name(param1, param2, optional_param=None):
    """
    [Function intent]
    Clear description of the function's purpose and role in the system.
    
    [Design principles]
    Patterns and approaches used, along with rationale for design choices.
    
    [Implementation details]
    Key technical implementation notes like algorithms used, processing flow, etc.
    
    Args:
        param1 (type): Description of first parameter
        param2 (type): Description of second parameter
        optional_param (type, optional): Description of optional parameter. Defaults to None.
        
    Returns:
        type: Description of return value
        
    Raises:
        ExceptionType: When and why this exception is raised
    """
```

This example illustrates the JavaScript documentation template using JSDoc format with the three-section pattern:

```javascript
// JavaScript class template showing JSDoc integration with mandatory documentation sections
/**
 * [Class intent]
 * Manages user authentication state and processes throughout the application.
 *
 * [Design principles]
 * Single responsibility for auth state management.
 * Clear separation between auth logic and UI components.
 *
 * [Implementation details]
 * Implements the Observer pattern to notify components of auth state changes.
 * Uses localStorage for persistent login state with encryption.
 *
 * @class AuthManager
 */
class AuthManager {
  /**
   * [Class method intent]
   * Creates a new AuthManager instance with initial configuration.
   *
   * [Design principles]
   * Fail-secure initialization with validation of stored credentials.
   *
   * [Implementation details]
   * Sets up listeners and initializes from encrypted localStorage if available.
   *
   * @param {Object} config - Configuration options
   * @param {boolean} config.autoRefresh - Whether to auto-refresh tokens
   */
  constructor(config) {
    // Implementation...
  }
}
