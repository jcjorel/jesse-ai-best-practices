#### Functional Intent & Features

This file implements FastMCP resource integration for the Jesse Framework MCP Knowledge Bases Hierarchical Indexing System, providing standardized MCP resource interfaces for accessing system configuration, processing templates, and comprehensive documentation through HTTP-formatted responses. The module enables external systems and users to access knowledge base system information through well-defined resource endpoints following Jesse Framework patterns. Key semantic entities include `register_knowledge_bases_resources()` function for centralized resource registration, `FastMCP` server integration with `@server.resource()` decorators, resource endpoints `jesse://knowledge_bases/config/default`, `jesse://knowledge_bases/templates/usage_examples`, and `jesse://knowledge_bases/documentation/system_overview`, `IndexingConfig` model integration for configuration access, `format_http_response()` utility for consistent HTTP formatting, `json` serialization for structured data responses, comprehensive error handling with `logger.error()`, and read-only resource access patterns maintaining system configuration integrity while providing practical usage examples and architectural documentation.

##### Main Components

The file contains the primary `register_knowledge_bases_resources()` function that registers three core MCP resource endpoints with the FastMCP server. The `knowledge_bases_default_config()` resource provides access to default indexing configuration parameters through `IndexingConfig().to_dict()` serialization with additional metadata for system understanding. The `knowledge_bases_usage_examples()` resource delivers practical workflow templates covering basic incremental indexing, full reindexing, project-wide indexing, and status monitoring scenarios with specific tool call parameters and use case descriptions. The `knowledge_bases_system_overview()` resource offers comprehensive system documentation including architecture overview, key component descriptions, processing patterns explanation, special scenario handling, and configuration guidance. Each resource implements comprehensive error handling with structured HTTP responses and detailed logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture follows FastMCP resource registration patterns with centralized resource management through a single registration function that decorates async resource handlers with `@server.resource()`. The design implements read-only resource access ensuring system configuration integrity while providing comprehensive information exposure through standardized HTTP-formatted responses. Key design patterns include the resource decorator pattern for MCP integration, structured data response pattern with consistent JSON formatting, comprehensive error handling pattern with HTTP status codes and detailed error information, and metadata enrichment pattern adding contextual information to core data. The system uses HTTP response formatting through `format_http_response()` utility maintaining consistency with Jesse Framework patterns and enabling proper MCP client integration.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses async resource handlers registered through FastMCP decorators with specific resource URI patterns following `jesse://knowledge_bases/` namespace convention. Configuration access employs `IndexingConfig()` instantiation with `to_dict()` serialization for structured parameter exposure, enhanced with descriptive metadata for usage guidance. Template provision uses structured dictionaries containing practical examples with tool call specifications, parameter configurations, and use case descriptions for different indexing scenarios. Documentation delivery implements nested dictionary structures covering system architecture, component descriptions, processing patterns, and configuration details. Error handling uses try-catch blocks with structured HTTP error responses including status codes, error messages, and detailed exception information for debugging support.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**→ Inbound:**
- `.models:IndexingConfig` - configuration data model providing default parameters and serialization capabilities
- `..helpers.async_http_formatter:format_http_response` - HTTP response formatting utility for consistent Jesse Framework response patterns
- `fastmcp:FastMCP` - MCP server framework providing resource registration and management capabilities
- `json` (external library) - JSON serialization support for structured data responses
- `logging` (external library) - structured logging for error tracking and debugging support

**← Outbound:**
- MCP clients - consume registered resources through FastMCP protocol for configuration and documentation access
- Jesse Framework MCP server - integrates registered resources into overall MCP server resource catalog
- External monitoring systems - access system configuration and status through MCP resource endpoints
- Development tools - consume usage examples and documentation for system integration and workflow development

**⚡ System role and ecosystem integration:**
- **System Role**: MCP resource provider for the Jesse Framework knowledge base indexing system, exposing configuration, templates, and documentation through standardized FastMCP resource interfaces
- **Ecosystem Position**: Peripheral interface component bridging the knowledge base indexing system with external MCP clients and development tools requiring system information access
- **Integration Pattern**: Registered with FastMCP server during system initialization, consumed by MCP clients through resource URI requests, and integrated with Jesse Framework HTTP formatting patterns for consistent response handling

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The system handles configuration instantiation failures through comprehensive try-catch blocks returning HTTP 500 responses with detailed error information and exception logging. Resource access errors are managed with structured error responses including specific error messages and technical details for debugging support. JSON serialization failures are caught and converted to HTTP error responses preventing resource access interruption. Missing or corrupted configuration data scenarios are handled through default configuration fallback with appropriate error logging. Network connectivity issues during resource access are managed through HTTP status code responses enabling proper client-side error handling. Resource URI pattern mismatches are handled by FastMCP framework with appropriate HTTP 404 responses for undefined resource endpoints.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The resource registration uses FastMCP decorator pattern with async function definitions enabling non-blocking resource access and proper MCP protocol integration. Configuration serialization employs `IndexingConfig().to_dict()` method with additional metadata dictionary construction for enhanced response context. Error logging uses structured logging with `exc_info=True` parameter for complete exception stack trace capture and debugging support. HTTP response formatting delegates to `format_http_response()` utility with status codes, response data, and content type specification for consistent Jesse Framework integration. Resource data structures use nested dictionaries with descriptive keys and comprehensive information organization supporting both programmatic access and human readability. Exception handling implements specific error message construction with technical details preservation for effective troubleshooting and system monitoring.

########### Code Usage Examples

Basic resource registration demonstrates the integration pattern for FastMCP server setup. This approach enables comprehensive knowledge base system information access through standardized MCP resource interfaces.

```python
# Register knowledge base resources with FastMCP server for MCP client access
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from jesse_framework_mcp.knowledge_bases.resources import register_knowledge_bases_resources

# Initialize FastMCP server and register knowledge base resources
server = FastMCP("jesse-framework-mcp")
register_knowledge_bases_resources(server)

# Resources are now available at:
# jesse://knowledge_bases/config/default
# jesse://knowledge_bases/templates/usage_examples  
# jesse://knowledge_bases/documentation/system_overview
```

Resource access pattern shows how MCP clients can retrieve system information and configuration data. This pattern enables external systems to understand and integrate with the knowledge base indexing system.

```python
# MCP client resource access pattern for knowledge base system information
import asyncio
from mcp_client import MCPClient

async def access_knowledge_base_resources():
    client = MCPClient("jesse-framework-mcp")
    
    # Access default configuration parameters
    config_response = await client.get_resource("jesse://knowledge_bases/config/default")
    config_data = json.loads(config_response)
    
    # Access usage examples and templates
    examples_response = await client.get_resource("jesse://knowledge_bases/templates/usage_examples")
    examples_data = json.loads(examples_response)
    
    # Access comprehensive system documentation
    docs_response = await client.get_resource("jesse://knowledge_bases/documentation/system_overview")
    docs_data = json.loads(docs_response)
```
