source_dir, target_dir = create_test_directory_structure(temp_dir)
print(f"Test structure created: {source_dir} -> {target_dir}")
```

Test specific functionality with mock context and configuration validation for isolated component verification. This demonstrates targeted testing without external dependencies:

```python
from test_indexing_core import MockContext
from jesse_framework_mcp.knowledge_bases.models.indexing_config import IndexingConfig, IndexingMode

# Create mock context for testing
ctx = MockContext()
config = IndexingConfig(indexing_mode=IndexingMode.FULL, debug_mode=True)

# Test configuration and filtering capabilities
test_files = [Path("src/main.py"), Path(".gitignore")]
processable = [f for f in test_files if config.should_process_file(f)]
```
