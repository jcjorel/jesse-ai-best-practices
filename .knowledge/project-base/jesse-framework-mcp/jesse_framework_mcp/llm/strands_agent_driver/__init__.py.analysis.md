#### Functional Intent & Features

This file serves as the package initialization module for the Strands Claude 4 Sonnet Driver, providing a centralized public API interface for Amazon Bedrock Claude 4 Sonnet integration using the Strands Agent SDK within the Jesse Framework MCP Server ecosystem. The module enables developers to access all driver functionality through a single import point with comprehensive conversation management, prompt caching, streaming support, and complete independence from Jesse MCP Server components. Key semantic entities include `StrandsClaude4Driver` main driver class, `ConversationManager` for session and cache management, `Claude4SonnetConfig` configuration class, `ConversationMemoryStrategy` enum for memory management options, exception classes `StrandsDriverError`, `ConversationError`, `ModelConfigurationError`, `CacheError`, `BedrockConnectionError`, `StreamingError`, and `TokenLimitError`, package metadata `__version__` set to "0.1.0", `__author__` attributed to "JESSE Framework", and `__all__` list defining the complete public API surface with 11 exported symbols. The system implements standard Python package initialization patterns with explicit import statements from submodules including `.driver`, `.conversation`, `.models`, and `.exceptions` for comprehensive functionality exposure.

##### Main Components

The file contains import statements from four internal modules providing comprehensive driver functionality. The `.driver` module exports `StrandsClaude4Driver` as the main driver class for Claude 4 Sonnet integration. The `.conversation` module provides `ConversationManager` for session and cache management capabilities. The `.models` module exports `Claude4SonnetConfig` configuration class and `ConversationMemoryStrategy` enum for memory management options. The `.exceptions` module provides seven exception classes including `StrandsDriverError`, `ConversationError`, `ModelConfigurationError`, `CacheError`, `BedrockConnectionError`, `StreamingError`, and `TokenLimitError` for comprehensive error handling. The module includes package metadata definitions and a complete `__all__` list ensuring controlled public API exposure with 11 total exported symbols.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements a standard Python package initialization pattern with explicit public API definition through `__all__` list and centralized import management from submodules. The design emphasizes clean API surface exposure with comprehensive functionality access through a single import point, following Python packaging best practices with explicit symbol exports. Key design patterns include the facade pattern providing unified access to distributed functionality across multiple modules, namespace pattern organizing related functionality into logical submodules, and explicit export pattern through `__all__` list controlling public API surface. The system uses relative imports for internal module access, package metadata for version and authorship tracking, and comprehensive exception hierarchy for error handling across all driver components.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses relative imports with dot notation for accessing internal modules including `.driver`, `.conversation`, `.models`, and `.exceptions` for clean namespace organization. Package metadata employs standard Python conventions with `__version__` string for semantic versioning and `__author__` attribution for package ownership. The approach implements explicit API control through `__all__` list containing 11 symbols ensuring only intended functionality is exposed during wildcard imports. Import organization follows logical grouping with main classes first, followed by configuration and enum types, and comprehensive exception hierarchy for complete error handling coverage. The system maintains package-level documentation describing core capabilities including Strands Agent SDK integration, prompt caching, streaming support, and Jesse MCP Server independence.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**→ Inbound:**
- `.driver:StrandsClaude4Driver` - main driver class providing Claude 4 Sonnet integration with AWS Bedrock through Strands Agent SDK
- `.conversation:ConversationManager` - conversation and cache management component for session persistence and performance optimization

- **Ecosystem Position**: Central API gateway serving as the primary interface for Claude 4 Sonnet integration, enabling clean separation between internal implementation and external consumption through controlled symbol exports
- **Integration Pattern**: Used by applications through standard Python import mechanisms, consumed by Jesse MCP Server through package-level imports, and integrated with development workflows through explicit API surface definition and comprehensive exception handling

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The system handles import failures gracefully through Python's standard import mechanism with potential `ImportError` exceptions if internal modules are missing or corrupted. Package initialization provides comprehensive exception hierarchy through seven distinct exception classes covering all potential failure scenarios including driver errors, conversation management issues, configuration problems, cache failures, AWS Bedrock connection issues, streaming errors, and token limit violations. The `__all__` list ensures controlled API exposure preventing accidental access to internal implementation details while maintaining comprehensive functionality access. Module organization handles circular import scenarios through careful dependency management and relative import usage. Package metadata provides version tracking for compatibility management and debugging support.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The package uses relative imports with single dot notation for accessing sibling modules within the same package structure. The `__all__` list contains exactly 11 symbols including 2 main classes, 1 configuration class, 1 enum, and 7 exception classes for comprehensive API coverage. Package metadata follows Python conventions with string literals for version ("0.1.0") and author ("JESSE Framework") information. Import statements are organized logically with main functionality first, followed by configuration components, and comprehensive exception hierarchy last. The module maintains minimal implementation with focus on API exposure and metadata definition, delegating all functional implementation to specialized submodules for clean separation of concerns.

########### Code Usage Examples

Basic package import demonstrates the standard pattern for accessing driver functionality through the public API. This approach provides clean access to all driver capabilities through a single import statement with explicit symbol access.

```python
# Import main driver components through package-level API for clean access to functionality
from strands_agent_driver import StrandsClaude4Driver, Claude4SonnetConfig, ConversationMemoryStrategy

# Initialize driver with configuration for Claude 4 Sonnet integration
config = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_conversations()
driver = StrandsClaude4Driver(config)
```

Comprehensive error handling showcases the exception hierarchy pattern for robust error management across all driver operations. This pattern demonstrates how to leverage the complete exception hierarchy for specific error handling and debugging support.

```python
# Import complete exception hierarchy for comprehensive error handling across driver operations
from strands_agent_driver import (
    StrandsDriverError, ConversationError, ModelConfigurationError,
    CacheError, BedrockConnectionError, StreamingError, TokenLimitError
)

try:
    # Driver operations that may raise various exceptions
    async with StrandsClaude4Driver(config) as driver:
        response = await driver.send_message("Hello", "conversation_id")
except BedrockConnectionError as e:
    print(f"AWS Bedrock connection failed: {e}")
except ConversationError as e:
    print(f"Conversation management error: {e}")
except StrandsDriverError as e:
    print(f"General driver error: {e}")
```
