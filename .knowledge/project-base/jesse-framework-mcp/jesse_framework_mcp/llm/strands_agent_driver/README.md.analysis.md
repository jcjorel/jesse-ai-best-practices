########### Code Usage Examples

Basic driver initialization demonstrates the foundational pattern for Claude 4 Sonnet integration with factory method configuration. This approach provides the essential setup pattern for async context management and conversation lifecycle handling.

```python
# Initialize Claude 4 Sonnet driver with optimized configuration for conversation management
import asyncio
from strands_agent_driver import StrandsClaude4Driver, Claude4SonnetConfig

async def basic_conversation():
    config = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_conversations()
    
    async with StrandsClaude4Driver(config) as driver:
        conversation_id = "my_conversation"
        await driver.start_conversation(conversation_id)
        
        response = await driver.send_message(
            "Hello! Can you explain quantum computing?",
            conversation_id
        )
        
        print(f"Claude: {response.content}")
        print(f"From cache: {response.from_cache}")
        print(f"Tokens used: {response.tokens_used}")

asyncio.run(basic_conversation())
```

Advanced streaming and caching integration showcases the comprehensive pattern for real-time response processing with performance optimization. This pattern demonstrates how to leverage streaming capabilities with intelligent caching for optimal user experience and cost efficiency.

```python
# Comprehensive streaming conversation with caching and performance optimization
async def streaming_with_caching():
    config = Claude4SonnetConfig(
        streaming=True,
        enable_prompt_caching=True,
        cache_ttl_seconds=1800,
        max_cache_entries=50,
        memory_strategy=ConversationMemoryStrategy.SUMMARIZING
    )
    
    async with StrandsClaude4Driver(config) as driver:
        conversation_id = "streaming_chat"
        await driver.start_conversation(conversation_id)
        
        async for chunk in driver.stream_conversation(
            "Write a story about space exploration",
            conversation_id
        ):
            print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
            
            if chunk.is_complete:
                print("\n--- Response complete ---")
                break
        
        # Get conversation statistics
        stats = await driver.get_conversation_stats(conversation_id)
        print(f"Messages: {stats['message_count']}")
        print(f"Total tokens: {stats['total_tokens']}")

asyncio.run(streaming_with_caching())
```
