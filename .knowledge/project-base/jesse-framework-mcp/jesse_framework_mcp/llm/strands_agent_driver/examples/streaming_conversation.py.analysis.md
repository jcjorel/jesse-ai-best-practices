#### Functional Intent & Features

This file implements a comprehensive streaming conversation demonstration script for the Claude 4 Sonnet driver, showcasing real-time response delivery through chunk-based streaming with performance comparison analysis between streaming and non-streaming modes for educational and testing purposes. The script enables developers to understand and validate streaming conversation patterns with the Strands Agent Driver system using live AWS Bedrock integration, demonstrating user experience improvements through immediate response feedback and detailed performance metrics collection. Key semantic entities include `streaming_conversation_example()` function for primary streaming demonstration, `compare_streaming_vs_normal()` function for performance comparison analysis, `StrandsClaude4Driver` class for AWS Bedrock integration, `Claude4SonnetConfig` configuration class with factory method `create_optimized_for_conversations()`, `stream_conversation()` method for chunk-based response streaming, `streaming` configuration parameter for enabling real-time delivery, chunk attributes `content` and `is_complete` for stream processing, conversation identifiers `streaming_example_conversation`, `normal_test`, and `streaming_test`, performance timing using `time.time()` measurements, `BedrockConnectionError` and `StrandsDriverError` exception classes, AWS environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_PROFILE`, and `AWS_REGION`, and comprehensive streaming statistics including chunk count, response times, average chunk sizes, and user experience metrics. The system implements async-first architecture with detailed console output formatting and educational demonstration patterns for streaming optimization understanding.

##### Main Components

The file contains three primary async functions providing comprehensive streaming conversation demonstration and analysis capabilities. The `streaming_conversation_example()` function performs the main streaming demonstration with predefined longer-form questions designed to generate substantial responses, real-time chunk processing with immediate console output, and detailed streaming statistics collection including chunk counts and timing analysis. The `compare_streaming_vs_normal()` function implements performance comparison testing between streaming and non-streaming modes, measuring time to first content delivery and total response times with user experience impact analysis. The `main()` function serves as the orchestration entry point with AWS credential validation, region detection, and sequential execution of both demonstration functions with comprehensive error handling and educational summary output. The script includes detailed performance timing using `time.time()` measurements, streaming statistics calculation and display, and structured console output with emoji-based visual indicators for different streaming phases.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements a demonstration-focused design pattern with clear separation between streaming validation and performance comparison analysis, following educational progression from basic streaming concepts to advanced performance optimization understanding. The design emphasizes real-time user experience through immediate chunk display and comprehensive performance measurement for educational value. Key design patterns include the streaming demonstration pattern with real-time chunk processing, performance comparison pattern with side-by-side timing analysis, async iteration pattern for chunk-based response handling, and educational pattern with detailed explanatory output and statistical reporting. The system uses conversation isolation through unique identifiers, comprehensive exception handling with specific error types, and structured console formatting with emoji indicators and section dividers for enhanced readability and learning experience.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses async context managers for proper resource lifecycle management with `StrandsClaude4Driver` instances and explicit streaming configuration through `Claude4SonnetConfig` factory method with `streaming=True` parameter. Streaming processing employs async iteration over `stream_conversation()` results with real-time chunk display using `print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)` for immediate user feedback. Performance measurement uses `time.time()` before and after streaming operations with precise timing calculations for first chunk delivery and total response times. The approach implements comprehensive statistics collection including chunk counting, response length measurement, and average chunk size calculation. Error handling uses specific exception types with user-friendly error messages and troubleshooting guidance. Console output employs structured formatting with emoji indicators, performance metrics display, and detailed comparative analysis for educational value.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The system handles missing AWS credentials gracefully by detecting environment variables and providing informative warnings with setup guidance without failing the demonstration. AWS Bedrock connection errors are caught with specific `BedrockConnectionError` handling and detailed troubleshooting steps including credential validation, Bedrock access verification, and model access confirmation. Driver operational errors are managed through `StrandsDriverError` exception handling with descriptive error messages. Keyboard interrupts are handled with clean exit messages and proper signal handling using `sys.exit(1)`. The script manages streaming interruption scenarios and incomplete chunk processing with comprehensive exception handling. Performance measurement edge cases include zero response times and division by zero scenarios with appropriate handling. Streaming statistics calculation handles empty responses and zero chunk counts with conditional logic to prevent calculation errors.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The demonstration uses hardcoded questions designed to generate longer responses including machine learning explanations, storytelling requests, and architecture discussions for effective streaming demonstration. Streaming configuration employs `create_optimized_for_conversations(streaming=True)` with explicit streaming enablement. Performance timing uses `time.time()` measurements with millisecond precision for first chunk detection and total response time calculation. Conversation IDs are explicitly set to `streaming_example_conversation`, `normal_test`, and `streaming_test` for clear session isolation. Console output uses structured formatting with specific emoji indicators, section dividers using `-` and `=` characters, and detailed statistical reporting including percentages and ratios. Streaming statistics include chunk counting, response length measurement, average chunk size calculation, and user experience impact analysis with comparative metrics display.

########### Code Usage Examples

Basic streaming configuration demonstrates the essential setup pattern for enabling real-time response delivery. This approach shows factory method usage with streaming parameter override and proper async context management for streaming operations.

```python
# Configure Claude 4 Sonnet driver with streaming enabled for real-time response delivery
config = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_conversations(streaming=True)

async with StrandsClaude4Driver(config) as driver:
    conversation_id = "streaming_example_conversation"
    await driver.start_conversation(conversation_id, {"example": "streaming"})
```

Streaming response processing showcases the async iteration pattern for real-time chunk handling with immediate user feedback. This pattern demonstrates how to process streaming responses with comprehensive statistics collection and performance measurement.

```python
# Process streaming responses with real-time chunk display and performance metrics
question = "Please write a detailed explanation of how machine learning works."

start_time = time.time()
full_response = ""
chunk_count = 0

async for chunk in driver.stream_conversation(question, conversation_id):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
    full_response += chunk.content
    chunk_count += 1
    
    if chunk.is_complete:
        break

end_time = time.time()
print(f"Chunks received: {chunk_count}")
print(f"Total time: {end_time - start_time:.2f}s")
print(f"Avg chunk size: {len(full_response) // chunk_count if chunk_count > 0 else 0} chars")
```
