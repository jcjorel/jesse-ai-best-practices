#### Functional Intent & Features

This file implements a demonstration script for the reasoning suppression feature in the Claude 4 Sonnet driver, showcasing the difference between suppressed and enabled reasoning output modes for educational and testing purposes. The script enables developers to understand and validate the behavior of reasoning suppression configurations in the Strands Agent Driver system with live AWS Bedrock integration. Key semantic entities include `demonstrate_reasoning_suppression()` function for live feature demonstration, `demonstrate_manual_configuration()` function for configuration examples, `StrandsClaude4Driver` class for AWS Bedrock integration, `Claude4SonnetConfig` configuration class with factory methods, `create_optimized_for_conversations()` and `create_optimized_for_analysis()` factory methods, `suppress_reasoning_output` configuration parameter, `stream_conversation()` method for real-time response streaming, `start_conversation()` method for session initialization, `StrandsDriverError` and `BedrockConnectionError` exception classes, AWS environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_PROFILE`, and `AWS_REGION`, conversation identifiers `reasoning_demo_suppressed` and `reasoning_demo_enabled`, and comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation for missing AWS credentials. The system implements async-first architecture with streaming response processing and detailed console output formatting for educational demonstration purposes.

##### Main Components

The file contains three primary async functions providing comprehensive reasoning suppression demonstration capabilities. The `demonstrate_reasoning_suppression()` function performs live testing with both suppressed and enabled reasoning configurations, using different conversation IDs and streaming response processing to show behavioral differences. The `demonstrate_manual_configuration()` function provides educational examples of explicit configuration options including override patterns for factory defaults. The `main()` function serves as the entry point with AWS credential validation, region detection, and orchestrated execution of both configuration examples and live demonstrations. The script includes comprehensive logging setup with structured formatting, path manipulation for module imports, and detailed console output with emoji-based visual indicators for different demonstration phases.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements a demonstration-focused design pattern with clear separation between educational configuration examples and live AWS Bedrock integration testing. The design follows async-first principles with comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation when AWS credentials are unavailable. Key design patterns include the demonstration pattern with side-by-side comparison of different configurations, factory method pattern usage for optimized configurations, streaming response pattern for real-time output processing, and educational pattern with detailed console formatting and explanatory text. The system uses context manager patterns for resource management, conversation isolation through unique identifiers, and comprehensive exception handling with user-friendly error messages and fallback behavior for missing dependencies.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses async context managers for proper resource lifecycle management with `StrandsClaude4Driver` instances. Configuration comparison employs factory methods `create_optimized_for_conversations()` and `create_optimized_for_analysis()` with different `suppress_reasoning_output` settings to demonstrate behavioral differences. Response streaming uses async iteration over `stream_conversation()` results with metadata inspection for reasoning event detection and content type classification. The approach implements comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks around AWS Bedrock operations and graceful degradation when credentials are missing. Console output uses structured formatting with emoji indicators, section dividers, and detailed explanatory text to enhance educational value. Path manipulation adds the parent directory structure to Python path for module imports without installation requirements.

- **Ecosystem Position**: Peripheral educational component supporting developer onboarding and feature validation, demonstrating core driver functionality without being part of production workflows
- **Integration Pattern**: Used by developers through direct script execution for learning and testing, consumed by documentation processes for feature explanation, and integrated with AWS Bedrock services for live demonstration when proper credentials are configured

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The system handles missing AWS credentials gracefully by detecting environment variables and providing informative warnings without failing the demonstration. AWS Bedrock connection errors are caught and handled with user-friendly messages explaining that failures are expected without proper access. Keyboard interrupts are handled with clean exit messages and proper signal handling. The script manages import path issues by dynamically adding parent directories to Python path for module access. Configuration errors are handled with detailed exception information and fallback to showing configuration examples only. Streaming response errors during live demonstration are caught and reported while allowing the demonstration to continue with educational content. The system provides comprehensive error context including specific AWS region information and credential setup guidance.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The demonstration uses hardcoded test questions designed to trigger Claude's reasoning process for effective feature demonstration. Conversation IDs are explicitly set to `reasoning_demo_suppressed` and `reasoning_demo_enabled` for clear session isolation. Response streaming implements chunk processing with content accumulation and metadata inspection for reasoning event detection. Console output uses structured formatting with specific character counts, section dividers using `=` and `-` characters, and emoji indicators for different phases. Error handling implements specific exception types with detailed error messages and graceful degradation paths. AWS credential detection checks multiple environment variables including `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_PROFILE` with default region fallback to `us-east-1`. The script maintains educational focus with detailed explanatory text and summary sections explaining the practical implications of different configuration choices.

########### Code Usage Examples

Basic reasoning suppression demonstration shows the core pattern for comparing different configuration behaviors. This approach provides side-by-side comparison of suppressed versus enabled reasoning output for educational purposes.

```python
# Demonstrate reasoning suppression with factory configurations
async def compare_reasoning_modes():
    # Configuration for suppressed reasoning (conversations)
    config_suppressed = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_conversations()
    
    # Configuration for enabled reasoning (analysis)
    config_enabled = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_analysis()
    
    test_question = "What are the pros and cons of microservices versus monolithic architecture?"
    
    # Test with suppressed reasoning
    async with StrandsClaude4Driver(config_suppressed) as driver:
        await driver.start_conversation("demo_suppressed")
        async for chunk in driver.stream_conversation(test_question, "demo_suppressed"):
            if chunk.content:
                print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```

Manual configuration override demonstrates how to customize reasoning suppression settings beyond factory defaults. This pattern shows explicit parameter control for specific use cases requiring different behavior than the optimized presets.

```python
# Manual configuration with explicit reasoning suppression control
def create_custom_configurations():
    # Explicitly suppress reasoning with custom temperature
    config_custom_suppressed = Claude4SonnetConfig(
        suppress_reasoning_output=True,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    
    # Override conversation default to show reasoning
    config_override = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_conversations(
        suppress_reasoning_output=False  # Override default suppression
    )
    
    # Override analysis default to hide reasoning
    config_analysis_override = Claude4SonnetConfig.create_optimized_for_analysis(
        suppress_reasoning_output=True  # Override default enabling
    )
```
