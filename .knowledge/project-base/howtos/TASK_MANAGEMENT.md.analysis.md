##### Main Components

The documentation contains ten primary sections providing comprehensive coverage of WIP task management capabilities within the JESSE AI Framework. The Task Management Overview section establishes the system architecture with mermaid diagrams showing task lifecycle, knowledge integration, and AI assistant integration relationships. The Task Lifecycle Management section covers task creation workflow, directory structure generation, and task activation processes. The Task Operations section details task switching, progress tracking with automatic updates, task completion with knowledge extraction, and task archiving procedures. The Knowledge Management Integration section explains task-level knowledge capture, cross-task knowledge sharing, and pattern reuse mechanisms. The Advanced Task Management section covers multi-task coordination, task templates, and analytics optimization. The Task Management Best Practices section provides daily management workflows, quality assurance procedures, and troubleshooting guidance. The Task Management Success Patterns section identifies high-performance characteristics and success metrics. Additional sections cover parallel task risk assessment, file restriction options, and long-term system evolution strategies.

###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements a hierarchical task management system with structured lifecycle workflows, automatic knowledge capture mechanisms, and seamless AI assistant integration, following modular design principles that enable independent task operation while supporting comprehensive knowledge accumulation and cross-task learning. The design emphasizes structured development through clear task definition templates, automatic progress tracking through test result integration and external resource capture, and knowledge persistence through systematic extraction and integration into persistent knowledge bases. Key design patterns include the lifecycle management pattern organizing tasks through creation, activation, progress, completion, switching, and archiving phases, the automatic capture pattern integrating knowledge from external sources and development activities, the template-driven pattern ensuring consistent task structure and documentation, the context preservation pattern maintaining development continuity across sessions, the risk assessment pattern managing parallel task conflicts through file restrictions and dependency tracking, and the knowledge integration pattern connecting task-specific learning with project-wide knowledge accumulation. The system uses mermaid diagrams for visual workflow representation and implements structured markdown templates with standardized sections for task definition, progress tracking, and knowledge capture.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses structured markdown templates with standardized sections for task definition, progress tracking, and knowledge capture, executed through command-line workflow integration with automatic trigger mechanisms for knowledge capture and progress updates. Task creation employs interactive prompts for task information gathering including name, objective, timeline, scope, success criteria, and dependencies with automatic snake_case conversion and directory structure generation. The approach implements automatic knowledge capture through integration with external search tools, web browsing activities, and test execution results with timestamp-based progress tracking. Task switching uses context preservation mechanisms capturing current session knowledge before loading new task context with Essential Knowledge Base updates. Progress tracking employs automatic test result integration, external resource capture, and manual knowledge consolidation through dedicated workflow commands. Task completion implements comprehensive knowledge extraction with pattern identification, solution documentation, and integration into Persistent Knowledge Base with archive creation and project status updates. Parallel task management uses risk assessment algorithms with file restriction options and dependency conflict detection to prevent development conflicts and maintain task isolation.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The documentation addresses parallel task management risks through comprehensive risk assessment including state inconsistency warnings when multiple WIP tasks are detected, file conflict prevention through restriction options and dependency tracking, and context confusion mitigation through clear task scope definition and switching protocols. Task lifecycle edge cases include task scope creep management through original scope review and separate task creation, stalled progress resolution through blocker identification and milestone breakdown, context loss recovery through WIP_TASK.md and PROGRESS.md review, and knowledge fragmentation prevention through regular knowledge capture workflows and cross-reference maintenance. System integration issues are handled through automatic capture failure recovery, session state corruption resolution through task disable and new session workflows, and knowledge base consistency maintenance through regular integrity checking. Quality assurance edge cases include incomplete task definition resolution through template compliance checking, progress tracking accuracy maintenance through automatic update verification, and milestone validation through objective completion criteria. Framework integration challenges address workflow command recognition failures, knowledge capture integration issues, and session continuity problems across development boundaries.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The task management system uses structured directory organization with `.knowledge/work-in-progress/[task_name_snake_case]/` containing `WIP_TASK.md` for task definition and learnings and `PROGRESS.md` for progress tracking and test results. Template structures implement standardized sections including task context with objective, scope, success criteria, dependencies, and timeline, task learnings with key discoveries, patterns identified, and challenges & solutions, and task resources with external links, reference materials, and tools & APIs. Automatic capture mechanisms integrate with external search tools for knowledge extraction, test execution systems for progress updates, and web browsing activities for resource documentation. Session management employs Essential Knowledge Base for current task tracking, context loading at session start, and automatic knowledge preservation during task switching. Knowledge integration uses pattern extraction algorithms for reusable solution identification, cross-reference maintenance for knowledge connectivity, and Persistent Knowledge Base updates for long-term learning preservation. Progress tracking implements timestamp-based updates, milestone completion verification, and blocker identification with resolution tracking.
