###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements a structured coaching system with Amazon's authentic Working Backwards methodology, following customer-obsessed design principles that prioritize customer value over internal business metrics through systematic document creation and quality assurance processes. The design emphasizes the 5-stage Working Backwards process with mandatory customer research, problem crystallization, multi-solution evaluation, experience design, and success measurement, integrated with sophisticated context window management and session continuity mechanisms. Key design patterns include the customer-centric methodology pattern ensuring all content focuses on customer value rather than company announcements, the 5-stage coaching pattern providing systematic progression through LISTEN, DEFINE, INVENT, REFINE, and TEST phases, the multi-solution evaluation pattern requiring minimum 3-5 solution options with Amazon's evaluation matrix, the 7-paragraph press release pattern with specific templates and requirements for each section, the comprehensive FAQ pattern addressing both customer-facing and internal stakeholder questions, the quality assurance pattern implementing Amazon's Top 10 writing guidelines with believability and readability testing, and the context management pattern providing graceful session handling with state preservation and resume capabilities. The system uses mermaid diagrams for visual methodology representation and implements sophisticated file management with working backwards directory structure and knowledge base integration.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses structured coaching workflows with Amazon's authentic templates and evaluation frameworks, executed through interactive guidance that adapts to user experience levels and provides comprehensive quality assurance throughout the document creation process. The approach implements the 5-stage Working Backwards process with mandatory customer research through surveys, interviews, analytics, and market research, problem definition using Amazon's specific template format with quantified impact and supporting evidence, solution development requiring minimum 3-5 options evaluated through Amazon's matrix considering customer impact, implementation effort, time to market, and strategic advantages. Document creation employs Amazon's 7-paragraph press release structure with specific templates for summary, problem, solution, leader quote, experience, testimonials, and call to action paragraphs. Quality assurance uses Amazon's Top 10 writing guidelines including customer testimonial mindset, simple language requirements, customer-relevant metrics, and believability testing. Context window management implements 80% threshold monitoring with graceful halt procedures, state saving, and session resume capabilities. File management uses structured directory organization with current and completed document separation and automatic knowledge base integration for persistent learning capture.
