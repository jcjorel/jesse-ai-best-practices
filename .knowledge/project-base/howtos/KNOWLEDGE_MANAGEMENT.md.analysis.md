###### Architecture & Design

The architecture implements a multi-layered knowledge management system with interconnected repositories and intelligent loading strategies, following hierarchical organization principles that enable persistent context management while optimizing AI assistant performance through automated capture and structured knowledge organization. The design emphasizes interconnected knowledge repositories with Essential Knowledge Base for project overview, Persistent Knowledge Base for detailed accumulated learnings, WIP Task Knowledge for active context, and external knowledge sources for reference materials, integrated with automatic capture mechanisms and lazy loading optimization. Key design patterns include the hierarchical knowledge pattern organizing information from project overview through detailed implementation specifics, the automatic capture pattern integrating knowledge from external sources without manual intervention, the lazy loading pattern optimizing context window usage through intelligent resource management, the trust source pattern ensuring knowledge traceability and verification, the single source of truth pattern preventing information duplication while enabling cross-referencing, and the time-based organization pattern maintaining historical context while prioritizing current information. The system uses mermaid diagrams for visual architecture representation and implements sophisticated file organization with dedicated directories for different knowledge types and automated capture integration.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses structured file organization with dedicated directories for different knowledge types, executed through automatic capture mechanisms and intelligent loading strategies that optimize context window usage while maintaining comprehensive knowledge persistence across AI assistant sessions. Knowledge organization employs hierarchical directory structure with `.knowledge/persistent-knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` for accumulated learnings, `.knowledge/work-in-progress/[task-name]/` for active task context, and `.coding_assistant/captured_chats/` for conversation archives. The approach implements automatic capture through integration with Perplexity MCP Server queries, web browsing activities, test execution results, and external API interactions with context-aware routing to appropriate knowledge locations. Lazy loading uses tiered strategy with always-loaded components including Essential Knowledge Base and current WIP task, on-demand loading for git clone and PDF knowledge bases, and controlled loading through disable commands and session reinitialization. Knowledge entry management requires mandatory trust sources with specific formatting including codebase references, git clone knowledge bases, web URLs, and documentation links. Quality assurance employs consistency checking workflows, cross-reference validation, and automated integrity verification. Manual capture uses dedicated workflow commands and explicit knowledge capture through conversational interfaces with structured output formatting.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The knowledge management system uses structured directory organization with `.knowledge/persistent-knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` for accumulated learnings, `.knowledge/work-in-progress/[task-name]/` containing `WIP_TASK.md` and `PROGRESS.md` files, and `.coding_assistant/captured_chats/` with timestamp-based naming pattern `[YYYYMMDD-HHmm]-[topic].md`. Automatic capture mechanisms integrate with Perplexity MCP Server queries routing to current WIP task or Persistent Knowledge Base based on context, web browsing results with source URL tracking, test execution results with structured logging including status, timestamp, command, summary, details, and context, and external API interactions with integration pattern documentation. Lazy loading implementation uses tiered strategy with always-loaded components including Essential Knowledge Base, current WIP task, and core framework rules, on-demand loading for git clone knowledge bases, PDF knowledge bases, and historical WIP tasks, and controlled loading through disable commands and session reinitialization. Trust source requirements mandate specific formatting with codebase references, git clone knowledge bases, web URLs, and documentation links for all knowledge entries. Quality assurance employs consistency checking workflows with cross-reference validity, trust source accessibility, knowledge duplication prevention, format compliance, and timestamp accuracy verification. Knowledge organization follows hierarchical principles with single source of truth, time-based prioritization, and cross-reference linking for comprehensive information management.

########### Usage Examples

Automatic knowledge capture demonstrates the framework's intelligent capture mechanisms for external knowledge integration. This pattern shows how knowledge is automatically routed to appropriate locations based on current development context without manual intervention.

```bash
# Automatic knowledge capture from Perplexity MCP Server queries and web browsing
# Routes knowledge to current WIP task if active, otherwise to Persistent Knowledge Base
# No manual intervention required - framework handles capture automatically

# When AI assistant uses Perplexity for research:
# Knowledge automatically captured with source attribution and context
# Integrated into appropriate knowledge base based on current session state

# When AI assistant browses web resources:
# Results automatically documented with source URLs and access timestamps
# Captured to persistent knowledge base for future reference and reuse
```

Manual knowledge capture showcases the explicit commands for preserving session insights and important discoveries. This pattern enables developers to capture specific knowledge that may not be automatically detected by the framework's capture mechanisms.

```bash
# Manual knowledge capture for session insights and important discoveries
# Provides explicit control over knowledge preservation and organization
/jesse_wip_task_capture_knowledge.md

# Explicit knowledge capture through conversational interface
# Enables targeted knowledge preservation with specific context and attribution
"Remember this: [specific knowledge to capture with detailed context]"
"Capture this knowledge: [important information for future reference]"

# Chat conversation capture for preserving technical discussions and decisions
# Creates structured documentation of important conversations and decision-making processes
/jesse_capture_our_chat.md
# Output: .coding_assistant/captured_chats/[YYYYMMDD-HHmm]-[topic].md
```

Knowledge base structure and trust sources demonstrate the mandatory format for all knowledge entries with comprehensive source attribution. This pattern ensures knowledge traceability and enables verification of information accuracy and currency.

```markdown
# Knowledge base entry structure with mandatory trust sources and comprehensive attribution
# Ensures knowledge traceability and enables verification of information accuracy
