# Task: MCP Server Context Size Optimization

## Git Integration
- **Branch**: jesse-wip/mcp_server_context_optimization
- **Parent Branch**: next-gen-mcp
- **Branch Created**: 2025-06-29T22:18:00Z
- **Branch Status**: Active

## Task Context

### Objective
Optimize the size of context returned by the JESSE Framework MCP server and rearchitect the server to rely less on lengthy markdown files sent as-is as context, moving toward smart runtime context generation. Progressively move content of the existing `<project_root>/artifacts/.clinerules/` into the MCP server Python code base for intelligent delivery.

### Scope
- **In Scope**: 
  - Analyze current context size and identify optimization opportunities
  - Research smart context generation approaches  
  - Evaluate migration path from static markdown to dynamic Python-based context
  - Design architecture for intelligent content delivery
  - Investigate current MCP server resource loading patterns
  - Document context size reduction opportunities
  - Explore progressive content migration strategies

- **Out of Scope** (for this initial phase):
  - Implementation details and technical architecture decisions
  - Specific code changes or refactoring work
  - Timeline and milestone planning
  - Performance benchmarking and testing

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete analysis of current context sizes across all MCP resources
- [ ] Document specific optimization opportunities with size reduction estimates
- [ ] Research and evaluate smart context generation approaches
- [ ] Design high-level architecture for migration from static to dynamic content
- [ ] Create migration strategy for moving `artifacts/.clinerules/` content to Python code

### Dependencies
- Understanding of current MCP server architecture and resource loading
- Analysis of JESSE Framework markdown content structure
- Knowledge of FastMCP framework capabilities for dynamic content generation

### Timeline
- **Started**: 2025-06-29T22:15:00Z
- **Target**: To be determined during analysis phase
- **Milestones**: 
  - Context size analysis completion
  - Architecture design completion
  - Migration strategy finalization
