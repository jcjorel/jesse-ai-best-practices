# Progress Tracking: Knowledge Bases Hierarchical Indexing System

## Session Initialization Status
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Session initialization command executed successfully
  - Command: `uv run python tests/test_project_root.py --dump`
  - Status: ✅ Completed successfully
  - Verification: Output includes project structure and resource content
  - **HARD BLOCKING**: No development work can proceed until completed

## Current Status
**Overall Progress**: 95% complete
**Current Phase**: Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-01T12:21:00Z

## Completed Milestones
### ✅ Core Architecture (2025-07-01)
- [x] Directory structure created (`knowledge-bases/` with models/ and indexing/ packages)
- [x] Data models implemented (`IndexingConfig`, `DirectoryContext`, `FileContext`, etc.)
- [x] `HierarchicalIndexer` implemented with leaf-first processing strategy
- [x] `KnowledgeBuilder` implemented with Claude 4 Sonnet integration
- [x] Comprehensive JESSE_CODE_COMMENTS.md standards compliance

### ✅ Supporting Components (2025-07-01)
- [x] `ChangeDetector` implemented with timestamp-based incremental processing
- [x] Special handlers for git-clones and project-base scenarios
- [x] FastMCP tools integration (`knowledge_bases_index_trigger`, `knowledge_bases_status`)
- [x] FastMCP resources integration (configuration, templates, documentation)
- [x] Main MCP server registration and integration complete

## Upcoming Milestones
- **2025-07-08** - Core architecture implementation complete
  - Directory structure created
  - HierarchicalIndexer class implemented
  - Change detection system functional
- **2025-07-15** - Full system integration complete

## Key Learnings & Discoveries

### Technical Implementation Insights
- **Leaf-First Processing Pattern**: Successfully implemented bottom-up hierarchical assembly ensuring child contexts complete before parent knowledge file generation
- **FastMCP Integration**: Seamless integration of complex hierarchical processing with FastMCP tools and resources, maintaining HTTP-formatted responses
- **Strands Agent Driver Integration**: Effective Claude 4 Sonnet integration through existing strands_agent_driver architecture for consistent LLM operations
- **JESSE_CODE_COMMENTS.md Compliance**: All components follow three-section documentation pattern with intent, design principles, and implementation details

### Architecture Design Success
- **Modular Component Design**: Clean separation between indexing orchestration, content building, change detection, and special handling
- **Configuration-Driven Behavior**: Comprehensive IndexingConfig enables flexible processing scenarios without code changes
- **Defensive Programming**: Extensive error handling enables graceful degradation when individual files or directories fail
- **Async-First Design**: Complete async architecture supporting concurrent processing and real-time progress reporting

### Framework Integration Excellence
- **Bottom-Up Knowledge Assembly**: Hierarchical Semantic Context pattern successfully implemented with no parent-to-child dependencies
- **Specialized Handling**: Git-clone and project-base scenarios handled through dedicated handlers maintaining system flexibility
- **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Full FastMCP tool and resource registration enabling external system integration
- **HTTP Response Consistency**: All tool and resource responses use http_formatter for JESSE Framework pattern compliance
