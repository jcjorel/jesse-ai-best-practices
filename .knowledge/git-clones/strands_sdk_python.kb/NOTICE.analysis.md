#### Functional Intent & Features

This `NOTICE` file establishes legal copyright ownership and intellectual property rights for the Strands Agents SDK repository, providing mandatory legal attribution required for `Apache-2.0` licensed software distribution. The file serves as a copyright declaration mechanism ensuring compliance with open source licensing requirements and protecting `Amazon.com, Inc.` intellectual property rights. Key semantic entities include `Copyright`, `Amazon.com, Inc.`, `affiliates`, and `All Rights Reserved` legal terminology establishing ownership boundaries. The notice implements standard copyright protection patterns required for enterprise open source software distribution and legal compliance frameworks.

##### Main Components

The file contains a single copyright statement declaring `Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates` as the rights holder with `All Rights Reserved` designation. The copyright notice follows standard legal formatting conventions for intellectual property declarations in software repositories. The content structure represents minimal legal compliance documentation without additional licensing terms or attribution requirements.

###### Architecture & Design

The notice follows a minimalist legal document design pattern containing only essential copyright ownership information without extended licensing terms or conditions. The structure implements standard copyright declaration formatting used across enterprise software repositories for legal protection. The design prioritizes brevity while maintaining legal enforceability through precise ownership attribution to `Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates`.

####### Implementation Approach

The copyright notice uses standard legal language patterns with `Copyright` prefix followed by entity identification and rights reservation clause. The implementation employs inclusive ownership designation through `or its affiliates` language covering subsidiary and related corporate entities. The approach maintains legal clarity through unambiguous ownership declaration without complex licensing terms or conditional usage rights.
