#### Functional Intent & Features

This file serves as a `Changie` changelog management configuration that automates changelog generation and version release documentation through structured change tracking and semantic versioning integration. The configuration provides automated changelog formatting through template-based rendering with `versionFormat: '## {{.Version}} - {{.Time.Format "2006-01-02"}}'` and `changeFormat: "* {{.Body}}"`, semantic versioning automation via `kinds` array mapping change types to version bumps, and file organization through `changesDir: .changes` and `unreleasedDir: unreleased` directory structure. Key semantic entities include `Changie` tool, `YAML` configuration format, `.changes/` directory, `unreleased/` subdirectory, `header.tpl.md` template, `CHANGELOG.md` output file, `versionExt: md` format specification, change kinds `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security` with corresponding `auto` version bump rules `minor`, `major`, `patch`, `newlines` formatting configuration, and `envPrefix: CHANGIE_` environment variable namespace. The configuration implements standardized release management through automated changelog generation, semantic version calculation, and consistent documentation formatting.

##### Main Components

The configuration contains six primary sections: directory structure specification defining `.changes/` as the working directory and `unreleased/` for pending changes, file path configuration establishing `header.tpl.md` template and `CHANGELOG.md` output locations, format templates controlling version headers, change kinds, and individual change entries, semantic versioning rules mapping six change types to automatic version bump strategies, formatting controls through `newlines` object specifying spacing around changelog sections, and environment variable configuration using `CHANGIE_` prefix for external integration. Each section provides specific automation capabilities for release documentation workflows.

###### Architecture & Design

The configuration follows a template-driven architecture that separates content generation from formatting through distinct template specifications and output controls. The design implements semantic versioning automation by mapping conventional change types to version increment rules, enabling automated release planning. The architecture uses directory-based organization with `.changes/` containing structured change files and `unreleased/` staging pending modifications. The structure provides flexible formatting through Go template syntax in `versionFormat` and `changeFormat` specifications, supporting customizable output generation.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses `Changie`'s YAML-based configuration system with Go template rendering for dynamic content generation. The approach employs conventional changelog categories following semantic versioning principles with explicit mapping between change types and version increments. Template formatting uses Go's time formatting with `2006-01-02` layout for consistent date representation and variable interpolation through `{{.Version}}` and `{{.Body}}` placeholders. The strategy includes environment variable integration through `envPrefix` for external configuration management and newline control for consistent markdown formatting.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**â†’ References:**
- `Changie` (external library) - changelog management tool that processes this configuration for automated release documentation
- `.changes/` directory - working directory containing structured change files for processing
- `unreleased/` directory - staging area for pending changes before release integration
- `header.tpl.md` - template file providing changelog header formatting and structure
- `CHANGELOG.md` - output file where generated changelog content is written
- `Go template engine` (external library) - processes template syntax in format specifications
- Environment variables with `CHANGIE_` prefix - external configuration source for runtime behavior modification

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The configuration handles missing template files through explicit path specification in `headerPath`, ensuring consistent header formatting across releases. Edge cases include version format conflicts addressed through standardized `2006-01-02` date layout and `md` extension specification. The framework manages change categorization ambiguity through explicit `kinds` definitions with clear semantic versioning mappings. Environment variable conflicts are prevented through `CHANGIE_` prefix isolation, avoiding namespace collisions with other tools.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The `kinds` array defines six conventional changelog categories with corresponding `auto` version bump specifications following semantic versioning rules where breaking changes trigger `major` increments, new features cause `minor` bumps, and bug fixes result in `patch` updates. The `newlines` configuration controls markdown formatting with `afterChangelogHeader: 1`, `beforeChangelogVersion: 1`, and `endOfVersion: 1` ensuring consistent spacing. Template variables use Go syntax with `.Version` and `.Time.Format` providing dynamic content insertion during generation. The `versionExt: md` setting ensures markdown compatibility for generated version sections.

########### Code Usage Examples

To generate a new changelog entry using this configuration, developers create change files in the designated directory structure:

```bash
changie new
```

This command creates a new change file in the `.changes/unreleased/` directory following the configured format and prompts for change type selection based on the defined kinds.

For releasing accumulated changes and updating the changelog, developers execute the batch command:

```bash
changie batch auto
```

This command processes all unreleased changes, determines the appropriate version bump based on the `auto` rules in the kinds configuration, and generates formatted changelog entries in `CHANGELOG.md` using the specified templates.
