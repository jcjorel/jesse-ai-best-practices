#### Functional Intent & Features

This file serves as a `Node Version Manager` configuration that specifies the Node.js runtime version for consistent development environment setup across team members and deployment pipelines. The configuration provides automatic Node.js version selection through the `lts/*` wildcard pattern, ensuring the project uses the latest Long Term Support release without manual version specification. Key semantic entities include `NVM` (Node Version Manager), `lts/*` wildcard pattern, `LTS` (Long Term Support) release channel, and `.nvmrc` configuration file format. The configuration implements development environment standardization by automatically resolving to the most recent stable Node.js LTS version, eliminating version compatibility issues and ensuring consistent runtime behavior across different development machines and CI/CD environments.

##### Main Components

The configuration contains a single directive specifying the Node.js version selection strategy through the `lts/*` pattern. This component provides dynamic version resolution that automatically selects the latest available Long Term Support release without requiring explicit version number maintenance. The pattern serves as both a version constraint and an automatic update mechanism for Node.js runtime management.

###### Architecture & Design

The configuration follows a minimalist design pattern that prioritizes stability and maintainability over version specificity. The architecture uses wildcard pattern matching to delegate version selection to NVM's resolution algorithm, ensuring automatic adoption of security updates and stability improvements within the LTS release channel. The design eliminates manual version maintenance overhead while maintaining compatibility guarantees through LTS channel constraints.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses NVM's pattern matching system with the `lts/*` wildcard to automatically resolve to the latest Long Term Support Node.js release. The approach leverages Node.js release lifecycle management, where LTS versions receive extended support and security updates for production environments. The pattern matching strategy provides automatic version updates within the stable release channel while preventing adoption of experimental or short-term support releases.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**â†’ References:**
- `NVM` (external library) - Node Version Manager for runtime version selection and installation
- `Node.js LTS releases` (external specification) - Long Term Support release channel providing stable runtime versions
- Development environment setup scripts - automated tooling that reads nvmrc for consistent Node.js version installation
- CI/CD pipeline configurations - continuous integration systems that use nvmrc for runtime environment preparation

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The configuration handles scenarios where no LTS version is available by falling back to NVM's default behavior or system-installed Node.js. Edge cases include situations where the latest LTS version introduces breaking changes for legacy dependencies, requiring manual intervention or version pinning. The wildcard pattern addresses version drift issues in team environments by ensuring all developers use compatible Node.js releases within the LTS stability guarantee.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The `lts/*` pattern instructs NVM to query the Node.js release API for the latest version tagged with LTS status, automatically resolving to specific version numbers during environment setup. The configuration file uses plain text format with single-line content, following NVM's standard parsing conventions. The pattern matching occurs during `nvm use` or `nvm install` operations, with resolution happening at runtime rather than configuration time.

########### Code Usage Examples

To activate the specified Node.js version in the current shell session, developers run the NVM use command:

```bash
nvm use
```

This command reads the .nvmrc file and switches to the latest LTS Node.js version, ensuring consistent runtime environment for development activities.

For automatic version installation and activation, developers can combine installation with usage:

```bash
nvm install && nvm use
```

This command sequence first installs the latest LTS Node.js version if not already present, then activates it for the current session, providing complete environment setup automation.
