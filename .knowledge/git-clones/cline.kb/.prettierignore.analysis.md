#### Functional Intent & Features

This file serves as a `Prettier` code formatter exclusion configuration that prevents automatic formatting of specific files and directories within the project, preserving intentional formatting choices and avoiding conflicts with generated or external content. The configuration provides selective formatting control through directory exclusions `dist/`, `node_modules`, `webview-ui/build/`, and `evals/`, file type exclusions via `*.md` wildcard pattern, dependency management exclusions through `package-lock.json`, and specific source file exclusions targeting `src/core/prompts/system.ts` and `src/core/prompts/model_prompts/claude4.ts`. Key semantic entities include `Prettier` formatter, `.prettierignore` configuration format, glob patterns `*.md`, directory paths with trailing slashes, specific TypeScript files in `src/core/prompts/`, build artifacts in `dist/` and `webview-ui/build/`, and evaluation data in `evals/`. The configuration implements development workflow optimization by excluding files that require manual formatting control or contain generated content that should not be automatically modified.

##### Main Components

The configuration contains four primary exclusion categories: build and distribution directories including `dist/` for compiled output and `webview-ui/build/` for frontend assets, dependency management files covering `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` to prevent formatting of external packages, documentation exclusions through `*.md` wildcard pattern for markdown files, and specific source code exclusions targeting prompt-related TypeScript files in the core system. Each category addresses different formatting requirements and workflow considerations for maintaining code quality without interfering with specialized content.

###### Architecture & Design

The configuration follows a hierarchical exclusion strategy that separates concerns between generated content, external dependencies, documentation, and specialized source files. The design uses both directory-level exclusions with trailing slashes and file-specific patterns to provide granular control over formatting scope. The architecture implements a whitelist approach where most project files receive automatic formatting while explicitly excluded items maintain their original formatting. The structure prioritizes development efficiency by preventing formatter conflicts with build processes and dependency management systems.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses Prettier's ignore file syntax with glob pattern matching for flexible file exclusion. Directory exclusions employ trailing slash notation to target entire directory trees, while file exclusions use both wildcard patterns and explicit path specifications. The approach balances automated code formatting benefits with manual control requirements for specialized content like AI prompts and generated documentation. Specific TypeScript file exclusions in `src/core/prompts/` suggest intentional formatting preservation for template or configuration files that require precise whitespace or structure.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**â†’ References:**
- `Prettier` (external library) - code formatter that processes prettierignore configuration for exclusion rules
- `dist/` directory - build output directory containing compiled artifacts that should not be reformatted
- `node_modules/` directory - npm package installation directory with external dependencies requiring format preservation
- `webview-ui/build/` directory - frontend build artifacts generated by bundling processes
- `package-lock.json` - npm dependency lock file with specific formatting requirements for version management
- `evals/` directory - evaluation data or test files that may contain specific formatting for analysis purposes

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The configuration handles scenarios where Prettier might interfere with generated content by explicitly excluding build directories and lock files. Edge cases include situations where markdown files contain code examples or formatted content that should preserve original structure, addressed through `*.md` wildcard exclusion. The framework manages conflicts between automated formatting and AI prompt templates by excluding specific TypeScript files in the prompts directory. Dependency-related formatting issues are prevented through comprehensive exclusion of `node_modules` and lock files that require exact formatting for proper functionality.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The exclusion patterns use Prettier's gitignore-style syntax with support for glob matching and directory traversal. Directory exclusions with trailing slashes ensure complete subtree exclusion rather than just matching directory names as files. The `*.md` pattern employs shell-style globbing to match all markdown files regardless of directory location. Specific file path exclusions use relative paths from the project root, targeting individual files that require formatting preservation for functional or template purposes.

########### Code Usage Examples

To add new file exclusions to the Prettier ignore configuration, developers append patterns following the established syntax:

```text
*.json
src/templates/
generated/
```

These additional exclusions prevent Prettier from formatting JSON configuration files, template directories, and generated code that should maintain specific formatting structures.

For verifying which files are excluded from formatting, developers can test Prettier's file discovery:

```bash
prettier --list-different --ignore-path .prettierignore "**/*.{js,ts,json,md}"
```

This command shows which files would be processed by Prettier while respecting the ignore configuration, helping developers understand the scope of automatic formatting within the project.
