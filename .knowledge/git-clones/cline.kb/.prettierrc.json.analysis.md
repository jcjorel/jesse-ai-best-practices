#### Functional Intent & Features

This file serves as a `Prettier` code formatter configuration that defines consistent formatting rules for automatic code styling across the project, ensuring uniform indentation, line width, and syntax preferences for all supported file types. The configuration provides tab-based indentation through `useTabs: true` with `tabWidth: 4`, extended line length via `printWidth: 130`, semicolon omission through `semi: false`, bracket positioning control via `bracketSameLine: true`, and Unix line ending enforcement through `endOfLine: "lf"`. Key semantic entities include `Prettier` formatter, `JSON` configuration format, `tabWidth` numeric setting, `useTabs` boolean flag, `printWidth` character limit, `semi` semicolon control, `bracketSameLine` bracket placement, and `endOfLine` line terminator specification. The configuration implements development workflow standardization by automatically applying consistent formatting rules during code editing and build processes, eliminating manual formatting decisions and reducing code review friction.

##### Main Components

The configuration contains six primary formatting rules: indentation control through `tabWidth` and `useTabs` settings establishing 4-space tab width with actual tab character usage, line length management via `printWidth` setting allowing 130 characters per line, punctuation preferences through `semi` flag disabling automatic semicolon insertion, bracket positioning control via `bracketSameLine` placing opening brackets on the same line as preceding elements, and line ending standardization through `endOfLine` enforcing Unix-style LF terminators. Each setting addresses specific code formatting aspects for comprehensive style consistency.

###### Architecture & Design

The configuration follows a declarative formatting architecture that separates style decisions from code logic through centralized rule specification. The design implements opinionated formatting choices that prioritize readability and consistency over individual preferences, using tab-based indentation for accessibility and extended line width for modern display compatibility. The architecture uses Prettier's configuration system to override default formatting behaviors with project-specific requirements. The structure provides comprehensive formatting coverage through minimal configuration options that affect all supported file types uniformly.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses Prettier's JSON configuration format with boolean and numeric values to specify formatting behaviors across all supported languages and file types. The approach employs tab characters for indentation rather than spaces, providing flexibility for developers with different visual preferences while maintaining consistent logical indentation. Line width extension to 130 characters accommodates modern development environments with wider displays. The strategy eliminates semicolons in JavaScript contexts where automatic semicolon insertion applies, reducing visual noise while maintaining syntactic correctness.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**â†’ References:**
- `Prettier` (external library) - code formatter that processes this configuration for automatic code styling
- Editor integrations - development environments that use Prettier configuration for format-on-save functionality
- Build systems - automated pipelines that apply Prettier formatting during code processing
- Version control hooks - pre-commit systems that enforce formatting consistency before code submission
- CI/CD pipelines - continuous integration systems that validate code formatting compliance

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The configuration handles cross-platform development through explicit `endOfLine: "lf"` specification, preventing Windows CRLF line ending conflicts in collaborative environments. Edge cases include semicolon insertion scenarios where `semi: false` relies on automatic semicolon insertion rules, requiring careful consideration of statement boundaries. The framework manages bracket placement consistency through `bracketSameLine: true`, ensuring uniform formatting across different code constructs. Tab width conflicts are resolved through explicit `tabWidth: 4` specification, providing consistent visual representation regardless of editor settings.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The `useTabs: true` setting instructs Prettier to use actual tab characters rather than space sequences for indentation, with `tabWidth: 4` defining the visual width representation. The `printWidth: 130` extends the default 80-character limit to accommodate longer expressions and modern display capabilities. The `semi: false` configuration disables automatic semicolon insertion in JavaScript and TypeScript contexts where semicolons are optional. The `bracketSameLine: true` places opening brackets immediately following the preceding element rather than on a new line, maintaining compact formatting.

########### Code Usage Examples

To apply Prettier formatting using this configuration, developers run the formatter command on their codebase:

```bash
prettier --write "src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,json,md}"
```

This command processes all specified file types in the src/ directory using the configuration settings, applying tab-based indentation, 130-character line width, and other specified formatting rules.

For integrating with editor workflows, developers configure their IDE to use Prettier with format-on-save functionality:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
}
```

This VSCode configuration automatically applies the Prettier formatting rules whenever files are saved, ensuring consistent code styling throughout the development process without manual intervention.
