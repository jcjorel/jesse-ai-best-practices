#### Functional Intent & Features

This file serves as the legal licensing framework for the Cline project, implementing the `Apache License Version 2.0` from January 2004 to establish comprehensive intellectual property rights and usage permissions for software distribution. The document provides standardized open source licensing terms covering copyright grants, patent protections, redistribution requirements, and liability limitations for commercial and non-commercial use. Key semantic entities include `Apache License`, `Version 2.0`, `TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION`, copyright holder `Cline Bot Inc.`, reference URL `http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0`, legal definitions for `License`, `Licensor`, `Legal Entity`, `You`, `Source`, `Object`, `Work`, `Derivative Works`, `Contribution`, and `Contributor`. The license implements perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free permissions with specific obligations for attribution, modification notices, and patent litigation termination clauses.

##### Main Components

The document contains eleven primary sections: definitions section establishing legal terminology for license interpretation, copyright license grant providing reproduction and distribution permissions, patent license grant covering patent claim protections, redistribution requirements specifying attribution and notice obligations, contribution submission terms defining default licensing conditions, trademark usage restrictions limiting brand name permissions, warranty disclaimer establishing "AS IS" distribution terms, liability limitation protecting contributors from damage claims, additional liability acceptance provisions for warranty offerings, terms and conditions conclusion, and appendix providing copyright notice template with project-specific attribution to Cline Bot Inc.

###### Architecture & Design

The license follows a hierarchical legal structure progressing from fundamental definitions through specific grant provisions to protective disclaimers and enforcement mechanisms. The design separates intellectual property rights into distinct copyright and patent domains with independent grant mechanisms and termination conditions. The architecture implements dual-form distribution support covering both source code and compiled object formats with corresponding attribution requirements. The structure provides escalating obligation levels from basic usage permissions to redistribution requirements and contribution licensing terms.

####### Implementation Approach

The implementation uses standardized Apache Software Foundation legal language with project-specific customization limited to copyright holder identification as "Cline Bot Inc." The approach defines comprehensive legal entity relationships through explicit terminology covering individual users, corporate entities, and control relationships. License grant implementation employs perpetual, irrevocable permissions with specific exception conditions for patent litigation scenarios. The redistribution framework requires license inclusion, modification notices, attribution preservation, and optional NOTICE file distribution across all derivative works.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**â†’ References:**
- `http://www.apache.org/licenses/` - Apache Software Foundation license repository providing authoritative license text
- `http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0` - specific Apache License Version 2.0 canonical reference URL
- `Apache Software Foundation` (external organization) - license framework provider and legal standard maintainer
- `Cline Bot Inc.` - copyright holder entity for project-specific license application

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

The license addresses patent litigation scenarios through automatic license termination provisions when recipients initiate patent infringement claims against the work or contributors. Trademark usage limitations prevent unauthorized brand exploitation while permitting reasonable attribution and origin description. The framework handles contribution ambiguity through explicit submission presumptions with override provisions for separate licensing agreements. Warranty and liability disclaimers address jurisdictional variations in applicable law requirements while maintaining maximum contributor protection across legal systems.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The license implements version 2.0 of the Apache License framework with January 2004 effective date and canonical URL reference for authoritative interpretation. Internal mechanisms include automatic contribution licensing under identical terms unless explicitly stated otherwise by contributors. The copyright notice template requires comment syntax adaptation for specific file formats while maintaining consistent attribution information. Legal entity control definitions specify 50% ownership thresholds and beneficial ownership criteria for corporate relationship determination.

########### Code Usage Examples

To apply this license to new source files, developers include the standard copyright notice with appropriate comment formatting:

```text
Copyright 2025 Cline Bot Inc.

Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
```

This notice establishes clear copyright ownership and license terms for individual source files within the project.

For redistribution compliance, distributors must include the complete license text and preserve all attribution notices:

```text
You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License
```

This requirement ensures license terms propagate with all distributed copies and derivative works, maintaining legal compliance throughout the distribution chain.
