#### Functional Intent & Features

This Code of Conduct document establishes behavioral standards and community guidelines for the strands_docs project by adopting the `Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct`. The file provides governance framework reference, conflict resolution pathways, and community participation guidelines through external policy delegation. Key semantic entities include `Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct` (primary governance framework), `aws.github.io/code-of-conduct` (policy specification URL), `Code of Conduct FAQ` (supplementary guidance resource), `aws.github.io/code-of-conduct-faq` (FAQ endpoint), and `opensource-codeofconduct@amazon.com` (contact mechanism), implementing standard open source project governance through Amazon's established community standards.

##### Main Components

The document contains three primary informational components: policy adoption statement referencing the Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct, supplementary resource link directing to the Code of Conduct FAQ, and direct contact information providing the `opensource-codeofconduct@amazon.com` email address for additional inquiries. Each component serves a distinct role in the governance communication hierarchy.

###### Architecture & Design

The content follows a minimalist delegation pattern that establishes governance authority through external reference rather than inline policy definition. The structure uses progressive information disclosure starting with primary policy adoption, followed by supplementary resources, and concluding with direct contact escalation. The design leverages Amazon's established governance infrastructure while maintaining project-specific applicability through explicit adoption declaration.

####### Implementation Approach

The governance implementation uses external policy inheritance with local adoption declaration, providing three-tier support escalation through primary documentation, FAQ resources, and direct email contact. The approach minimizes maintenance overhead by delegating policy content to Amazon's centralized governance system while establishing clear project-specific adoption and contact pathways for community members.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**â†’ References:**
- `https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct` - primary governance policy specification
- `https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct-faq` - supplementary guidance documentation  
- `opensource-codeofconduct@amazon.com` - direct contact escalation endpoint
- `Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct` - external governance framework
- `AWS GitHub organization` - policy hosting infrastructure

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

Potential governance edge cases include external policy URL accessibility failures requiring local policy fallback, email contact unavailability necessitating alternative communication channels, and policy version changes at the Amazon source requiring project-specific adoption updates. The delegation approach creates dependency on Amazon's infrastructure availability and policy stability for effective governance enforcement.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The document uses standard Markdown formatting with H2 header structure, hyperlink syntax for external references, and plain text email contact specification. The content organization follows a logical flow from policy declaration through resource provision to contact information, maintaining minimal file size while providing comprehensive governance coverage through external delegation.

########### Code Usage Examples

Essential governance reference patterns for project contributors and maintainers. This example demonstrates the complete document structure and formatting approach for governance delegation.
