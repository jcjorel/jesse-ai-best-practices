#### Functional Intent & Features

This `.lycheeignore` file provides URL exclusion configuration for the `lychee` link checker tool, preventing validation attempts on specific URL patterns that are known to be problematic or intentionally inaccessible during automated link checking processes. The file enables reliable documentation link validation by filtering out localhost addresses, development servers, and external domains that commonly block automated requests or have accessibility restrictions. Key semantic entities include `lychee` (link checking tool), `https://github.com/opensafely/documentation/blob/main/.lycheeignore` (reference implementation), `https?://locahost.*` and `https?://127\.0\.0\.1.*` (localhost patterns), `.*localhost.*` (general localhost matching), `https?://www\.oecd\.org.*` (OECD domain exclusion), and `https?://.*\.openai\.com.*` (OpenAI domain exclusion), implementing regex-based URL pattern matching for automated link validation workflows.

##### Main Components

The ignore configuration contains five distinct URL pattern exclusions organized into localhost development patterns (`https?://locahost.*`, `https?://127\.0\.0\.1.*`, `.*localhost.*`) and external domain exclusions (`https?://www\.oecd\.org.*`, `https?://.*\.openai\.com.*`). The file includes a reference comment pointing to the OpenSAFELY documentation implementation and uses regex pattern syntax for flexible URL matching across different protocols and subdomains.

###### Architecture & Design

The exclusion patterns follow a hierarchical filtering strategy combining protocol-agnostic regex patterns (`https?://`) with domain-specific matching rules and wildcard subdomain support (`.*`). The design separates local development environment exclusions from external service domain filtering, using escaped dot notation (`\.`) for literal IP address matching and wildcard patterns for comprehensive subdomain coverage. The architecture supports both exact domain matching and flexible pattern-based exclusions.

####### Implementation Approach

The lychee ignore implementation uses PCRE-compatible regex patterns with protocol flexibility through optional 's' matching in `https?://`, escaped character sequences for literal dot matching in IP addresses (`127\.0\.0\.1`), and wildcard domain matching through `.*` quantifiers. The approach targets common link checking failure scenarios including localhost development servers, IP-based local addresses, and external domains with bot protection or rate limiting mechanisms.

######## External Dependencies & Integration Points

**â†’ References:**
- `lychee` (external tool) - link checking engine that processes ignore patterns
- `https://github.com/opensafely/documentation/blob/main/.lycheeignore` - reference implementation example
- `https://www.oecd.org` - excluded external domain with potential access restrictions
- `https://openai.com` - excluded external domain with API rate limiting
- Documentation build systems - CI/CD pipelines that execute link validation
- Regex engines - pattern matching processors for URL filtering

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

Pattern matching edge cases include typo handling for `locahost` (missing 'l') which catches common misspellings, IPv4 address variations that might not match the exact `127.0.0.1` pattern, subdomain wildcards that could over-exclude valid links, and protocol variations beyond HTTP/HTTPS. The OECD and OpenAI domain exclusions address specific external service limitations including bot detection, rate limiting, and geographic access restrictions that cause false positive link validation failures.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The ignore file uses Unix-style line endings with hash-prefixed comments for documentation, regex metacharacter escaping for literal character matching, and protocol-optional patterns supporting both HTTP and HTTPS schemes. The pattern ordering follows logical grouping from local development exclusions to external domain filtering without functional precedence requirements. The file format aligns with standard ignore file conventions used across link checking tools.

########### Code Usage Examples

Essential lychee ignore pattern applications for documentation link validation workflows. These examples demonstrate common exclusion patterns and their regex syntax for reliable link checking.

```bash
# Run lychee with ignore file
lychee --config .lycheeignore docs/

# Test specific pattern matching
echo "https://localhost:3000" | grep -E "https?://locahost.*|.*localhost.*"
```

```regex
# Localhost development server patterns
https?://locahost.*
https?://127\.0\.0\.1.*
.*localhost.*

# External domain exclusions
https?://www\.oecd\.org.*
https?://.*\.openai\.com.*
```

The lycheeignore configuration ensures reliable automated link validation by excluding problematic URL patterns that would otherwise cause false positive failures in documentation quality assurance workflows.
