#### Functional Intent & Features

This CONTRIBUTING.md document establishes comprehensive contribution guidelines and community engagement protocols for the Strands Agents documentation project, providing structured pathways for bug reporting, feature requests, pull request submissions, and security issue handling. The file enables standardized contributor onboarding, quality assurance through defined processes, and legal compliance through licensing acknowledgment and code of conduct adoption. Key semantic entities include `GitHub issue tracker` (bug reporting system), `pull requests` (contribution mechanism), `main branch` (primary development branch), `Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct` (governance framework), `https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct` (conduct policy), `AWS/Amazon Security` (security reporting), `http://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/` (vulnerability endpoint), `LICENSE` file (legal framework), `help wanted` label (contribution targeting), and GitHub workflow references for `forking a repository` and `creating a pull request`, implementing standard open source project governance with Amazon-specific security and legal requirements.

##### Main Components

The document contains seven primary sections: introductory welcome message establishing contribution value and community appreciation; Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests section detailing GitHub issue tracker usage and required information elements; Contributing via Pull Requests section outlining pre-submission requirements and step-by-step submission process; Finding contributions to work on section highlighting GitHub issue labels and `help wanted` targeting; Code of Conduct section referencing Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct adoption; Security issue notifications section establishing AWS Security reporting procedures; and Licensing section referencing LICENSE file requirements and contribution confirmation processes.

###### Architecture & Design

The contribution framework follows a progressive engagement model starting with issue reporting, advancing through pull request contributions, and culminating in ongoing community participation. The design separates concerns between bug reporting (GitHub issues), code contributions (pull requests), security concerns (AWS Security channels), and governance (Code of Conduct), while maintaining integration through consistent GitHub workflow references and Amazon corporate policy alignment. The structure emphasizes quality assurance through pre-submission checklists and automated CI integration.

####### Implementation Approach

The contribution implementation uses GitHub-native workflows with issue tracker integration, fork-based development model, and branch-specific targeting to the `main` branch. The approach combines community-driven contribution discovery through issue labels with structured submission processes including local testing requirements, clear commit messaging, and automated CI monitoring. The strategy emphasizes communication through issue discussion for significant work and continuous engagement during pull request review cycles.

######### Edge Cases & Error Handling

Contribution edge cases include duplicate issue reporting addressed through existing issue checking requirements, significant work conflicts prevented through mandatory issue discussion, and security vulnerability mishandling mitigated through explicit AWS Security reporting channels with public GitHub issue prohibition. The pull request process addresses code quality issues through local testing requirements and automated CI failure monitoring, while licensing conflicts are managed through explicit contribution confirmation requirements and LICENSE file references.

########## Internal Implementation Details

The document uses standard Markdown formatting with numbered lists for procedural guidance, hyperlink integration for external resource references, and emphasis formatting for critical security warnings. The contribution workflow relies on GitHub's native forking model with repository-specific branch targeting, while the issue management system leverages default GitHub labels including `enhancement`, `bug`, `duplicate`, `help wanted`, `invalid`, `question`, and `wontfix` for contribution categorization and community engagement.

########### Code Usage Examples

Essential contribution workflow patterns for community engagement and code submission processes. These examples demonstrate practical application of the contribution guidelines for different participation scenarios.

```bash
# Fork and clone repository for contribution
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/strands_docs.git
cd strands_docs
git checkout main
```

```bash
# Create feature branch and submit pull request
git checkout -b feature/your-contribution
# Make changes and test locally
git add .
git commit -m "Clear description of changes"
git push origin feature/your-contribution
```

```markdown
# Security issue reporting template (private communication)
Subject: Security Vulnerability in Strands Agents Documentation
Report via: http://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/
Do NOT create public GitHub issue for security concerns
```

The CONTRIBUTING.md document provides comprehensive guidance for community participation in the Strands Agents documentation project while ensuring quality, security, and legal compliance through structured processes and external resource integration.
